abstract = {The conventional model in studies of elite politics in China is that elite interaction is a game of "winner take all." This research note proposes, however that a new feature of China's elite politics in the twenty first century is "power balancing"-a feature that has resulted from political institutionalization and functional differentiation. In an institutionalized environment, political rules and institutions play important roles. In a functionally differentiated system, power is not absolute and indivisible. Political leaders have power in institutionally-defined and separable domains. This paper introduces a power-balancing model and makes a preliminary attempt at applying it to current-day elite politics in China. Through preliminary analysis of five key events, this analysis suggests that political succession did take place at the Sixteenth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) when Jiang Zemin stepped down as General Secretary and was succeeded by Hu Jintao. The outcome of the first session of the Tenth National People's Congress (NPC) and the first session of the Tenth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in March 2003 was also a balance between Hu Jintao and his allies on the one hand and Jiang Zemin and his associates on the other. Hu Jintao scored substantial gains through his hard work in the fight against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), while Jiang's image was seriously damaged Hu in effect institutionalized ideology in his July I speech and promoted inner-Party democracy at the Third Plenum of the Sixteenth Central Committee.},

abstract = {China is frequently portrayed as a problem case for the law and development movement because it has achieved economic growth with a weak legal system, has resisted the third wave of democratization, and has a poor record on civil and political rights. Is China a problem case? The author thinks not, or at least that it is too early to tell. China is now following the path of other East Asian countries that have achieved sustained economic growth, established rule of law, and developed constitutional or rights-based democracies, albeit not necessarily liberal rights-based democracies. At this stage of development, for all of its problems, China is meeting or exceeding expectations on most measures. China outperforms the average country in its income class in terms of economic growth, rule of law and most human rights measures, and other indicators of human well-being with the notable exception of civil and political rights.},

abstract = {The emergence of a new triangle among the LTS, Japan, and China has overshadowed the preceding relationship among the US, the former Soviet Union, and China although the structure is relatively infantile, unstable and loose. Due to the radical shift in power capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region, and theluctuation in economic, technological, military, political, and socio-economic foundations of national power, the bilateral basis of the triangular structure is move unstable than was the case in the past. Diverging political structures, decision-making systems, belief systems, leadership factors, misperceptions, as well as systemic dynamics are impacting on individual state behavior. The significance of internal sources of foreign policy is nowhere more important than the inter-Korean process, where weapons proliferation, and possible regime collapse pose serious security challenges. The concerned outside powers must recognize the inherent limitations of their influence on Pyongyang's evolution, and the domestic conditions that drive Pyongyang's adventurous policy. Here, the recognition that only Kim Jong-il as of this moment can drive through any limited reform in the context of military/political guarantees to his regime, most probably from China and Russia, and possibly from the LIS, and South Korea must be made. In order to facilitate this process, outside powers must encourage "reKoreanization" of the inter-Korean process. In this regard, a gradual autonomization of national security in South Korea is essential.},

abstract = {Development theory suggests that political innovation tends to occur as levels of well-being rise and markets expand. it is interesting to note, in this context, that a number of significant political reforms in rural China have begun in poorer rural areas. This has been the case with the return to household farming, village elections and now township elections. Crisis and distance from political centres, combined with astute political leadership, can stimulate significant institutional reforms that may affect nationwide policy. While elections for village leadership in China are generally accepted as legitimate, elections for township heads are more deeply contested and with the township forming the lowest level of state administration, it is nested in a more complex set of institutional relations. Direct election of township heads (as in Buyun, Sichuan) province has been declared unconstitutional but this has not stopped experimentation with alternative methods to evaluate township officials. One such promising experimentation is the "open recommendation and selection" process that has been carried out in Suining Municipality, Sichuan Province. This process broadens the scope of participation in the selection of local leaders but it retains the Leninist concern for control of the process and, most importantly, it does not contravene the constitution. This article suggests that without clear guidance from the centre, the only solutions available for localities to resolve the dilemmas they face are to experiment with procedures that operate within existing guidelines and to exploit the grey areas to enhance local representation and institutional adjustment.},

@article{Mikheev1997a,
abstract = {This article deals with analysis of the Russia-China strategic cooperation formula announced in the Russian-Chinese political declaration signed last April in Moscow. The formula aroused many questions: What could it mean? How realistic is the "strategic cooperation" idea? What might be its impact on global and regional security? A modern history of the development of the relationship between Russia and China does not present obvious answers to these questions. After the 1989 formal normalization of Russian-Chinese relations, there appeared ideas about strategic technological cooperation in a new triangle: Russia, China and South Korea. However, these were nothing more than ideas. After the collapse of the USSR, Russian diplomacy gave priority to its relations with the West, leaving aside cooperation with China. In 1993-1994 Russia corrected its approach to China: China was named "a perspective partner" and "a great prosperous neighbor." In 1995-1997 Moscow began to look at China in the light of the Russian-American dispute over NATO enlargement eastward and growing dissatisfaction with Western "insufficient" economic assistance (as they think in Moscow) for Russian reforms. The concepts that China is a "more reliable" and "easy-to-talk-to" partner than the West and that Russia should develop a "strategic cooperation" partnership with China were added to the Russian foreign-policy arsenal. The main goal of the article is to examine the conception of Russian-Chinese strategic cooperation from different standpoints. This is to analyze Russian and Chinese approaches to their bilateral strategic cooperation, objective possibilities and resources, as well as impediments to the strategic cooperation, and, finally, to present various scenarios of the strategic cooperation. The article tries to explain what really stands behind the idea of Russian-Chinese strategic cooperation, political bluffing or something pragmatic, and whether other countries should fear Russian-Chinese strategic cooperation and consider countermeasures, or feel it is necessary. The article tries to prove that Russian-Chinese strategic cooperation in its military-political, economic, historical, and ecological aspects, is an illusion today. Both Russia and China clearly understand that their, hypothetically imagined, military-political strategic cooperation would increase tensions in the Asia Pacific-and to some extent worldwide-and they are more inclined to speculate on such an idea in international relations than be able to do anything substantial. The article argues that, hypothetically, economic, ecological, and historical scenarios of Russian-Chinese strategic cooperation could contribute to regional and global security and co-prosperity, as well as to the creation of economic and civilization basis for a unified world. Nowadays, however, it is too early to think seriously about such kind of perspectives. The most likely is a variant of restricted strategic cooperation, which means maintaining normal, good-neighborhood security relations and development of mutually beneficial economic and military-trade relations.},

@article{Chao1993,
abstract = {Due to the impact of the 1989 pro-democracy movement and the political changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, the CCPs Fourteenth National Congress failed to further the reform of the political structure, a task initiated by the previous congress. The decision of the last congress to restrict the Party's leadership to political matters was abandoned while the definition of the Party's Twelfth National Congress that the Party exercises political, ideological and organizational leadership was readopted. Previous efforts to separate the functions of the Party from those of the government were undermined when top Party cadres assumed important concurrent posts in the government. In the wake of the Party's Fourteen th National Congress, the focus of discussion was organizational streamlining, which does not affect the Party's rule and is the easiest of all political restructuring tasks. So far, the efforts to separate government administration from enterprise management have not produced much result. However, as state-run enterprises become state-owned enterprises according to the decision of the congress, enterprises will have greater autonomy. How can Party committees in enterprises help factory directors and fulfill their ''guaranteeing and supervising role without causing excessive interference? This will be a severe lest.},

abstract = {This article examines Russian Government policy towards Northeast Asia as an interplay between aspirations, which have been expressed by government leaders, parliamentary figures and prominent academics and journalists and actual results. The article uses three levels, global, regional and bilateral, as a basis for the analysis. In terms of global interests the Russian leadership has sought diplomatic balance against the US, in terms of regional interests the leadership has pursued the aim of economic and security integration while at the bilateral level Russian leadership has sought specific benefits from particular relations with China, Japan and South Korea. The article notes that Russia has obtained certain diplomatic benefits from the relationship with China which serve its interests at the global level. At the regional level policy aspirations have been frustrated by Russia's dire economic condition and the tendency to be treated as an 'outsider'. Russia has benefited from an improvement of bilateral relations with China, Japan and South Korea but these gains do not translate into an improved position at the regional level yet. while the Russian leadership has been nurturing the development of bilateral relationships problems particular to those relationships hinder its wider regional acceptance.},

abstract = {As frequent, violent, and organized peasant protests show, China's reform regime has lost its once all-powerful control in the countryside. The sharp decline of village cadres' positional authority in allocating economic resources, which began in post-Mao decollectivization, holds the key to explaining the change. Since the late 1990s, the collapse of village enterprises and the erosion of power over land have cost village cadres their remaining economic levers to engage the villagers as well as their incentives to work for the party-state. The loss of the regime's grip on village cadres and the loss of command by village cadres on peasants have almost synchronized, causing the traditional structure of organizational control to crumble in vast rural areas. In the new, prevailing patterns of village governance, party power is becoming increasingly irrelevant.},

abstract = {East Asia integration is characterized by informal integration, which distinguish East Asia from other regions emphasizing formal integration. The Regional Production Network (RPN) is a major type of informal integration. It was built by Japanese firms trying to create a Japanese-led multi-tier division of labor ill East Asia. The theoretical basis of the RPN is the flying geese model (proposed by Akamatsu) and its modern variants. The RPN was instrumental in forging production ties among East Asian countries and has helped the export-led industrialization of East Asian economies. The RPN helped to drive Asian integration in the absence of strong formal integrative institutions in the region. However, the RPN is built upon the dependence of other East Asian economies on Japan for technology and on the US for market. The system is likely to break down when the Japanese economy stagnates or when the US can no longer absorb the increasing exports. The breakdown of the RPN is the production factor for the Asian financial crisis. The flying geese model is also static in that it does not reflect the rapid catching up of certain followers. The dominance of the RPN has been challenged by the ethnic Chinese business networks, another type of informal integration. The Chinese networks have helped some ethnic Chinese economies, such as Taiwan and China, enabling them to perform better in the Asian crisis and to catch up with the industrialized countries in global competition. The evolution of the RPN reflects the changing nature of East Asian political economy.},

abstract = {Russia's President Vladimir Putin has centralized decision making in Moscow and has reduced the role of domestic actors. He has demonstrated his own personal management of foreign policy in relation to China and Japan. He has used negotiations over oil and territory to place Russia in a more favourable position between them. In relation to oil, he has overruled the oil company Yukos and others within his own government and decided in favour of the Japanese pipeline route, which includes a branch line to China. Putin decided on the Japanese route because it promised access to wider markets in the Asia Pacific, besides China. It also entailed deeper Japanese involvement in Russia's development and reduced Russian dependence upon China. In terms of territory, Putin undermined the power of local opposition and offered territorial settlements to both China and Japan, to remove sources of future tension. With China he compromised over the river islands which had been left outstanding since the main border agreement was signed in 1991. To Japan he again offered a compromise over the disputed islands based on the 1956 agreement to improve relations. Russians may hope that energy dependence would induce the Japanese to become more willing to compromise over the territorial issue. The Japanese, however, expect that Russia's need for funding for the pipeline would allow them to resist that pressure and to demand a return of all disputed islands. If Russia emerges as an energy supplier to both China and Japan its influence and its regional role would be enhanced. Much depends upon the prospects for the oil pipeline and its branch line, whose feasibility has been questioned.},

abstract = {This study investigated request and refusal strategies in the question-response sequences of interactions in routine press conferences held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China and the US Department of State oil the topic of the North Korea nuclear crisis during a period of 5 months. All utterances by journalists were identified as requests, and instances of spokespersons' non-compliance with requests were considered to be refusals. Findings demonstrated that: (1) request for specific information was the most frequently adopted strategy in both US and Chinese press conferences, but more clarification and confirmation questions were used in the US data and more questions for comments were found in the Chinese data: (2) in the case of refusals. direct refusals and reasons for refusal were frequent in the US data while avoidance and insufficient answers were prevalent in the Chinese data. The cross-cultural differences in the strategies of requests and refusals arc discussed briefly in relation to different ideological and cultural assumptions.},

A concerted diplomatic effort to woo countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which now includes all countries in the region excepting East Timor, has reaped multiple benefits for Beijing. It is beginning to alter the political balance in the region as alignments with extra-regional powers are shifting, however subtly. In some aspects, the change is more dramatic. Economic relations have expanded rapidly; for example, trade between China and Southeast Asia is 17 times larger today than it was 25 years ago. },

@article{Moon1998,
abstract = {When addressing administrative reform, many scholars have referred to the fact that governments confront multiple internal challenges such as fiscal stress, distrust of bureaucracy and higher demands for public services (Peters and Savoie 1995). Externally, governments become more sensitive to global issues and tend to be more influenced by international environments (Garcia-Zamor and Khator 1994). Faced with internal and external challenges, governments seek new paradigms for governance (Ingraham and Romzek 1994) and often initiate administrative reform (AX) aimed at enhancing governmental performance and improving the administrative system through technological advances, managerial improvements, administrative innovations and continued enhancement of administrative capabilities (Caiden 1991). Administrative reform and its diffusion among Western countries are well documented in the literature (Campbell and Peters 1988; Savoie 1994; Halligan 1996; Peters and Savoie 1995). However, studies are skewed toward Western countries and little attention has been paid to Asia. Even less attention has been paid to comparative studies on Asian administrative reform, even though many Asian countries have developed their own AR trajectories to improve public efficiency and productivity (Burns 1994; Zhang, De Guzman, and Reforma 1992). As many students of comparative public administration (CPA) understand, it is always a challenging task, both methodologically and theoretically, to examine a group of different countries (Aberbach and Rockman 1987; Heady 1996a; 1996b; Peters 1988; Peters 1996). It is an even more challenging and controversial task to develop a single comparative framework from which we can examine differ ent countries. This article attempts to fill a gap in the literature by examining Asian AX from a comparative perspective. First, we propose an exploratory theoretical framework, a Political Nexus Triad (PNT). PNT is an extended model, which adds civil society as the third dimension to the traditional politics-administration model. We suggest the PNT and its dynamic trajectory as a building block of the comparative study of Asian administrative reform. This is similar to the power interaction models in which Peters (1988) addresses the power interactions between politicians and bureaucrats.(1) Second, we examine the conventional patterns of PNT for three Asian countries: China, Japan, and Korea. Third, we survey AR of the three countries, focusing on actors, contents and potential impacts to the new PNT. Finally, we discuss conclusions and comparisons.},

abstract = {The development of a more autonomous civil society and a public sphere in the reforming state socialist regimes of Hungary and China occurred through the conflictual and cooperative interaction between state and society. Specifically, the process of development of a civil society was influenced by the pattern of coalitions among groups within society and the political establishment, both of which became more pluralistic during the course of reform. A coalition of reformers in the Communist party leadership and moderates in the protest movement enabled the emergence of democracy in Hungary, whereas the absence of such a coalition resulted in the Tiananmen crisis and the postponement of further political reform in China.},

abstract = {A prominent American geographer discusses geopolitical implications of U.S. penetration into a vast Eurasian Convergence Zone, within which the influence of major world geopolitical powers (Maritime Europe, Russia, China, India, and Japan) converge. Following a discussion of the nature of U.S. activity in major subsections of the Zone (Eastern Europe, Transcaucasus, Central Asia, and East Asia), the author examines economic, demographic, and military strategic stakes of the major geopolitical powers in the region. Concluding sections assess the complex relationships (both cooperative and competitive) among the U.S. and abutting powers in the Zone and outline ways that U.S. foreign policy objectives might be supported.},

abstract = {Is China moving toward hegemonic ambitions in Asia and the world, or is it a benign state naturally expanding its interests as its power grows? The question prompts major debates among China specialists around the world. This paper joins the debate by examining China's most critical security relationships to see what they reveal about the PRC's ambitions. This paper begins with the widely accepted assumption that national economic development will continue to be China's most important objective into the early twenty-first century. Economic modernization conditions, colors, and prompts most other PRC policies. Accordingly, as the PRC enters the twenty-first century bordering fourteen other countries (five of them nuclear armed or believed to be nuclear capable), China's leadership wants a stable and tranquil external environment with which to work and one not dominated by any single power nor set of security alliances. The paper examines in turn PRC security relations with Russia, Japan, Europe, the two Koreas, Southeast Asia, South Asia, the US, and Taiwan. The burgeoning Sino-Russian arms connection, the PRC's periodic tensions with Japan and India, the mixed conflict and cooperation with the US, and Beijing's strategy toward Taipei are all treated. The study concludes that in each case (including Taiwan) Chinese policy reflects a general conservativeness and caution. Thus the American foreign policy approach toward China of "engagement" makes sense. Nationalism, however, is now a powerful force in Chinese policies in the post-Deng era. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that China will permanently continue its cautious approach towards international security.},

abstract = {The strategic partnership between Moscow and Beijing is arguably the greatest Russian foreign policy achievement of the post-Soviet period. In just over a decade, the relationship has grown from a barely civil interaction to one of political and strategic convergence and flourishing economic cooperation. Once divisive issues such as border demarcation and Chinese 'illegal migration' into the Russian Far East have been largely defused, while bilateral trade has tripled during the past four years. Nevertheless, despite these successes, the strategic partnership remains fragile and vulnerable to bilateral and international developments. A negative historical legacy, enduring cultural prejudices and strategic suspicions, and even commercial disagreements threaten, over time, to undermine many of the gains of the recent past. In the transformed global environment after 9/11 there are signs that Moscow is rethinking its approach towards China as part of a more general evolution in Russian strategic calculus in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. China's emergence as the next superpower, the spectre of increased Sino-American tensions, the changing balance of power between Moscow and Beijing, and rival agendas in Central Asia all have the potential to rekindle once dormant political differences and security fears. Although the breadth of common interests means there is no early prospect of confrontation, the much-vaunted Russia-China strategic partnership may be giving way to a growing strategic divergence.},

abstract = {This article studies East Asian political economy from a regional perspective. The Asian financial crisis showed that East Asian economies are highly regionalized. However, the linkages among Asian economies, mostly informal in nature, often appear "invisible" to many in the West, who focus more on the states and formal institutions. Drawing on a broad set of literature mostly in Asian languages, this paper provides a systematic study of informal integration in East Asia, which consists of not only regional production networks, but also ethnic Chinese business networks and subregional economic zones. It finds that the three informal mechanisms have formed an interrelated pattern of regional integration in East Asia. The nature of the economic networks is very useful in explaining the Asian crisis and the different performances Of. East. Asian economies in the crisis. The crisis has also resulted in profound changes in informal integration. While the Japanese-led production networks have been greatly weakened, the Chinese Economic Area is rising, driven by the ethnic Chinese business networks and subregional economic zones. As a result, the Japan-dominated "flying geese pattern" has been broken. The connections between Greater China and the United States have also been enhanced and are out-competing the Japanese production networks. Many of the new developments have been ignored in the-Vest but they are key factors that will shape the future of Asian and World political economy.},

abstract = {This article has three goals. The first is to characterize the nature of the current Chinese political system, culminating at the 16th Party Congress, as a combination of economic, domestic political and foreign policy reform. Economically, it represents a continuation of marketization, privatization and globalization under more centrally controlled auspices. Politically, it represents a continuation of Dengist emphases on elite civility and administrative institutionalization. And in foreign policy, it brings China to the threshold of great power status, as the old ambivalence between overthrowing the international system and assuming an important role within it nears resolution. The second purpose, viewing "Jiangism" in comparative developmental terms, conceives political development in terms of both state-building and nation-building: the greatest emphasis has been on the former. The third goal is to subject Jiangism to immanent critique by pointing out the most conspicuous emergent contradictions. These seem to include gaps between rich and poor and between east and west, a largely unsuccessful attempt to reform the nation's industrial core and its attendant financial system, and a paradoxical inability to police the state even while increasing state capacity.},

@article{Buszynski2000,
abstract = {This article examines Russian Government policy towards Northeast Asia as an interplay between aspirations, which have been expressed by government leaders, parliamentary figures and prominent academics and journalists and actual results. The article uses three levels, global, regional and bilateral, as a basis for the analysis. In terms of global interests the Russian leadership has sought diplomatic balance against the US, in terms of regional interests the leadership has pursued the aim of economic and security integration while at the bilateral level Russian leadership has sought specific benefits from particular relations with China, Japan and South Korea. The article notes that Russia has obtained certain diplomatic benefits from the relationship with China which serve its interests at the global level. At the regional level policy aspirations have been frustrated by Russia's dire economic condition and the tendency to be treated as an 'outsider'. Russia has benefited from an improvement of bilateral relations with China, Japan and South Korea but these gains do not translate into an improved position at the regional level yet. while the Russian leadership has been nurturing the development of bilateral relationships problems particular to those relationships hinder its wider regional acceptance.},

@article{Khadka1997a,
abstract = {Nepal has been one of the regular and first recipients of Chinese aid. Ever since the resumption of diplomatic relations in 1955, China's relations with Nepal have been generally friendly. Due to the connections between Nepal and Tibet in the past and the former's geographic location, China considers Nepal a country of strategic importance. This was particularly so during the Cold War years. China has had three major foreign policy interests in Nepal over the years-strategic, political, and economic. This article examines these major policy motivations for China's aid to Nepal and postulates certain implications far China's aid policy in the post-Cold War period. The article concludes that China's aid has generally been successful in maintaining its strategic interests and countering the influence of India and other powers in Nepal, and that although superpower interests in Nepal may have been diminished in the post-Cold WI. years, China's interest in Nepal will remain vital sc, long as ifs position in Tibet remains unchanged. This implies that China will continue its politics of aid to Nepal in order to maintain the latter's commitment to supporting the former's position in Tibet.},

abstract = {Incumbent political leaders risk deposition by challengers within the existing political rules and by revolutionary threats. Building on Bueno de Mesquita, Smith, Siverson, and Morrow’s selectorate theory, the model here examines the policy responses of office-seeking leaders to revolutionary threats. Whether leaders suppress public goods such as freedom of assembly and freedom of information to hinder the organizational ability of potential revolutionaries or appease potential revolutionaries by increasing the provision of public goods depends, in part, on the sources of government revenues. Empirical tests show that governments with access to revenue sources that require few labor inputs by the citizens, such as natural resource rents or foreign aid, reduce the provision of public goods and increase the odds of increased authoritarianism in the face of revolutionary pressures. In contrast, without these sources of unearned revenues, governments respond to revolutionary pressures by increasing the provision of public goods and democratizing.},

abstract = {East Asia integration is characterized by informal integration, which distinguish East Asia from other regions emphasizing formal integration. The Regional Production Network (RPN) is a major type of informal integration. It was built by Japanese firms trying to create a Japanese-led multi-tier division of labor ill East Asia. The theoretical basis of the RPN is the flying geese model (proposed by Akamatsu) and its modern variants. The RPN was instrumental in forging production ties among East Asian countries and has helped the export-led industrialization of East Asian economies. The RPN helped to drive Asian integration in the absence of strong formal integrative institutions in the region. However, the RPN is built upon the dependence of other East Asian economies on Japan for technology and on the US for market. The system is likely to break down when the Japanese economy stagnates or when the US can no longer absorb the increasing exports. The breakdown of the RPN is the production factor for the Asian financial crisis. The flying geese model is also static in that it does not reflect the rapid catching up of certain followers. The dominance of the RPN has been challenged by the ethnic Chinese business networks, another type of informal integration. The Chinese networks have helped some ethnic Chinese economies, such as Taiwan and China, enabling them to perform better in the Asian crisis and to catch up with the industrialized countries in global competition. The evolution of the RPN reflects the changing nature of East Asian political economy.},

First, groups differ in the benefits they receive from cooperation. This affects which groups can commit to cooperate. Second, a nation may selectively withhold cooperation from one group to influence the domestic political competition between groups in another nation. By integrating political competition between leaders of different groups under different institutional rules into a prisoner’s dilemma model of international cooperation, the theory generates hypotheses relating leader turnover, group membership, and patterns of cooperation.},

abstract = {India has come a long way from the days of Gandhian and Nehruvian foreign policy. Morally high principles, which had guided India's foreign policy since independence, have now been left behind. A more pragmatic approach to defending its own national interests is informing India's foreign policy makers today. Convinced that it needs both China and the United States for further significant economic development, India is endeavoring to manage its relationship with these two major powers very delicately, with no simple choice of favoring one over the other. While the United States can naturally be more helpful in terms of India's economic and military security, China has been playing a more significant role with regard to energy and other regional issues. The rise of India as a major economic and military power has changed the fundamental structure of the world system that came into existence after the end of the Cold War. Both Eastern and Western camps, led by the United States and China respectively, are trying to draw India closer to their side. To this effect, both sides are offering various economic, military and other incentives, yet India has so far avoided the temptation of joining any one camp and has rather managed to follow its own course. From the study of recent Indian foreign policy initiatives, it is becoming clear that India is actively trying to intensify its engagement within the East Asian region.},

abstract = {Although there is a body of research regarding the development of village self-governance in China, there is only limited research regarding the activity of international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in relation to this development. The paper fills this gap through an analysis of the activities and effects of the village self-governance programs of three American-based NGOs: the International Republican Institute (IRI), the Carter Center and the Ford Foundation. These NGOs have assisted in the implementation of a number of reforms to village self-governance in China. NGO involvement in village democracy in China exemplifies a process of 'political globalisation' that involves the intermingling of layers of power and interests at the national and international levels. The paper concludes that, through this process of political globalisation, rural political reforms in China are both promoted and exploited by national and international political actors.},

abstract = {China's aspirations of becoming a world power are well-stated. Consistent with this goal, China is seeking to enhance and maintain military power credible with such a position. Until it is able to complete this process and concurrently stabilize its economy and internal polity, China will continue to seek a period of peace and tranquility. However, its long-term strategy is clearly to become the dominant economic and military power in Asia mid cognizable player in the world. China professes a policy of peace and friendliness toward India. However, it has been creating a ring of anti-Indian influences aimed at the strategic marginalization of India. China's relations with the United States are marked by competition over influence in Asia-Pacific region. However, its strong economic linkages with the United States are likely to cushion adverse impact of irritants in their relations. China is also improving its relations with Russia with a view to obtain technology, arms and perhaps, strategic support against US hegemony. Chinese foreign policy demonstrates pragmatic linkages between its domestic priorities and external conduct. However, its growing stakes in the world will tend to make it behave in an increasingly benign manner. A revamped foreign policy will optimize India's relations with China as indeed with the rest of the world.},

abstract = {This paper describes a case study of the behavior of an online learner by visualizing log file records using a tool (learnogram) we developed. In this study, we chose a simple yet very intensive fully-online learning environment (for learning Hebrew vocabulary) and one student who uses it. With the help of brainstorming meetings with three education experts, fifteen learning variables were listed; some of them were formally defined and calculated. We conclude the paper with a discussion about the challenges this method raises and its great potential towards the development of adaptive Web-based learning environments. },
annote = {S.50: Kategorisierung der Verhaltensweisen sehr interessant:

        
* Group view at the ending point of the learning process: Betreff: Anzahl der Hits auf einer Webseite pro Gruppe
* Group view of the whole learning process: Wie entwickelt sich die Gruppe insgesamt? Welche Pfade zum Lernen entwickeln sich
* Individual view at the ending-point of the learning process: Individuelle Differenzen werden herausgearbeitet -> s.a. Artikel von Rita Viola
* Individual view of the whole process: Wie arbeitet das Individuum, wie entwickeln sich der Lernprozess: Qualitatives Abbild des Lernfortschritts -> Wird hier n\"{a}her beleuchtet.

        
"This way, analyzing the log files enables us to virtually view this learner, as if we were watching him from aside. The tool we develop – learnogram – promotes the understanding of the online learner’s
behavior, by visualizing learning variables (see section Methodology)."

        
Auch sehr interessant:

        
"The literature on online learning addresses, among other things, methods for
constructing and managing an online course, ways of improving online teaching, and
factors affecting success in online courses. But seldom light is shed on the perspective
of the online learner, his or her cognitive characteristics and the affective aspects of
his or her learning process [19]."

        

        
"Higher-level variables, describing the characteristics of learners' online learning
process, may be found in a few studies. These are often divided into two groups: a)
cognitive and metacognitive variables; and b) emotional and motivational variables
[22, 23]. Attempts have also been made to find correlations between online learning
characteristics and affective states of the learner [4, 24]."

        
Interessant ist dabei die Verlagerung auf den Lerner (andere Artikel -> s. Autor mit Feedback-Mechanismen). Die Erfassung von bestimmten Grenzvariablen erlaubt eine Interpretation hinsichtlich der h\"{o}heren Lernstrategie! Das ist wohl sehr bedeutend.

        
Wichtig ist also das Vorgehen bei der Zusammenstellung der Grundvariablen, die das individuelle Lernen gestalten. Die Autoren schlagen folgenden Verlauf vor:
a. Definition von Grundvariablen und deren Berechnung -> Sollte umfassend gepr\"{u}ft und hinreichender Menge erfolgen
b. Die Lernvariablen k\"{o}nnen die Grundlage f\"{u}r die Vergleichung von Individuen darstellen. Verteilung \"{u}ber gro\ss e Populationen! Frage: wie gehts damit der Lernentwicklung \"{u}ber die Zeit zusammen???
c. Ableitung von h\"{o}heren Variablen -> wirkliche kognitive Lernvariablen aufgrund der Grunddaten. Ergibt sich aus den Mustern der Lernens. Frage: Wer leitet diese h\"{o}heren geistigen Prozesse ab?
->Metakognitive Komponenten... Clusteranalyse?? Decision Trees? Wer interpetiert das?},

abstract = {Hong Kongs 1997 reversion to Chinese sovereignty brought two hitherto distinctive social policy systems into one country. As Hong Kong is gradually assimilated into China in the coming decodes, the two social policy systems will need to identify elements of convergence. In this article, we argue those elements con be found in parallel efforts to curtail the reach of the state, extend the role of the market, enhance individual responsibility, and in the development of a productivist social policy orientation in both societies. The social policy systems of the two societies remain strikingly different in many ways, reflecting their diametrically opposed starting points. But their reform trajectories appear to be pointing in similar directions.},

abstract = {Western historiography on the idea of freedom in modern China has tended to focus on its conception as service to the state and social ends, as illustrated by studies of Liang Qichao's democratic thought; as a result, many other interpretations have been overlooked. This article locates Chinese notions of liberty in a broader context as a fusion of personal, national, social, civic, and moral freedoms. After revisiting Liang Qichao's conception of freedom, it posits six others that are mutually interactive-freedom as liberation; as self-development, independent personality, and responsibility; as democracy and human rights; as a spiritual cultural necessity; as a private realm; and as autonomy and self-mastery. The article offers a more nuanced understanding of the issue of the primacy of collective interests over individual interests by developing the notion of dual responsibilities, or the dualism between the sanctity of personal liberty and the public morality of service to society and state.},

abstract = {The strategic partnership between Moscow and Beijing is arguably the greatest Russian foreign policy achievement of the post-Soviet period. In just over a decade, the relationship has grown from a barely civil interaction to one of political and strategic convergence and flourishing economic cooperation. Once divisive issues such as border demarcation and Chinese 'illegal migration' into the Russian Far East have been largely defused, while bilateral trade has tripled during the past four years. Nevertheless, despite these successes, the strategic partnership remains fragile and vulnerable to bilateral and international developments. A negative historical legacy, enduring cultural prejudices and strategic suspicions, and even commercial disagreements threaten, over time, to undermine many of the gains of the recent past. In the transformed global environment after 9/11 there are signs that Moscow is rethinking its approach towards China as part of a more general evolution in Russian strategic calculus in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. China's emergence as the next superpower, the spectre of increased Sino-American tensions, the changing balance of power between Moscow and Beijing, and rival agendas in Central Asia all have the potential to rekindle once dormant political differences and security fears. Although the breadth of common interests means there is no early prospect of confrontation, the much-vaunted Russia-China strategic partnership may be giving way to a growing strategic divergence.},

abstract = {India has come a long way from the days of Gandhian and Nehruvian foreign policy. Morally high principles, which had guided India's foreign policy since independence, have now been left behind. A more pragmatic approach to defending its own national interests is informing India's foreign policy makers today. Convinced that it needs both China and the United States for further significant economic development, India is endeavoring to manage its relationship with these two major powers very delicately, with no simple choice of favoring one over the other. While the United States can naturally be more helpful in terms of India's economic and military security, China has been playing a more significant role with regard to energy and other regional issues. The rise of India as a major economic and military power has changed the fundamental structure of the world system that came into existence after the end of the Cold War. Both Eastern and Western camps, led by the United States and China respectively, are trying to draw India closer to their side. To this effect, both sides are offering various economic, military and other incentives, yet India has so far avoided the temptation of joining any one camp and has rather managed to follow its own course. From the study of recent Indian foreign policy initiatives, it is becoming clear that India is actively trying to intensify its engagement within the East Asian region.},

abstract = {Conventional understandings of Chinese nationalism often portray it as anti-Western,focusing on Chinese nationalists' obsession with a powerful state and on their ambition to recover the glory of China's historical empire. Such understandings clearly underlie the fear and hostility toward rising Chinese nationalism today. But this view relies too heavily on China's conflictive relations with the West and overemphasizes the impact of China's unique history, culture, and politics, making it hard, if not impossible, to draw on the concept of nationalism in understanding China's relations with its non-Western neighbors. Such a perspective neglects the importance of ideas and ideals from the international system that animate Chinese nationalism. In this article, the author characterizes Chinese nationalism as fusing realpolitik ideas and ideals and a fervent quest for national identity and power A realpolitik nationalist, as defined here, is someone who frames an external threat to China in terms not of the country's unique culture or history but of a breach of the prevailing norms of the nation-state system, whose key dimensions include sovereignty, territoriality, and international legitimacy. Finally, the author applies this notion in examining China's conflicts with India in 1962 and with the Southeast Asian countries involved in the dispute over the Spratly Islands.},

abstract = {In the late 1970s, the economic size ratio between the Soviet Union and China was 4 to 1. In 2001, the ratio between Russia and China was less than 1 to 4, or even less than 1 to 5, if one includes Hong Kong with China. Although the collapse and dissolution of the Soviet Union contributed to this profound reversal of economic strength, domestic factors have been more important: decollectivization of Chinese agriculture versus an unwillingness to reform in Russia, the establishment of township village enterprises in China versus an extremely weak small and medium enterprise sector in Russia, economic openness and market-preserving federalism in China versus limited participation in globalization and confused federalism in Russia. Although Russia was faster than China in privatizing state-owned enterprises, the preferential treatment of insiders and the weakness of the rule of law or functional substitutes for it neutralized this potential Russian advantage. The strength and character of Chinese nationalism might also help it to outgrow Russia. While the rise of China and the corresponding power transitions imply security risks, reinforced by China's central geopolitical location, there are also opportunities, because of the pacifying impact of free trade and globalization and prospects for democratization. By trade China might become prosperous and, ultimately, even democratic. In the long run, a "capitalist peace" between China, Russia, and the West is conceivable.},

abstract = {This manuscript explores the state’s political use of the past and the function of history education in political transition and foreign relations. Modern historical consciousness in China is largely characterized by the ‘‘one hundred years of humiliation’’ from mid-1800s to mid- 1900s when China was attacked, bullied, and torn asunder by imperialists. This research focuses initially on how such historical memory has been reinforced by the current regime’s educational socialization through the national ‘‘Patriotic Education Campaign’’ after 1991. It then explores the impact of this institutionalized historical consciousness on the formation of national identity and foreign relations. This study suggests that, even though existing theories and literature illuminate certain aspects of China’s political transition and foreign affairs behavior, a full explanatory picture emerges only after these phenomena and actions are analyzed through the ‘‘lenses’’ of history and memory.},

abstract = {What can the study of democratization in Southeast Asia contribute to our knowledge of democratization more generally? This literature exhibits two noteworthy strengths. First, Southeast Asianists have been more attentive than most general democratization theorists to structural influences on political regime outcomes: especially the power of authoritarian institutions, such as party, military, and state apparatuses, in shaping the fate of nondemocratic regimes. Second, rather than introducing completely new hypotheses or definitively testing familiar arguments, Southeast Asian regime studies play a vital role in elaborating and regenerating hypotheses for further consideration. Deep area knowledge thus serves not only to amass the raw material upon which broader theories are initially built, but also to pinpoint informative anomalies and to assess the causal mechanisms underlying our leading theories. As scholars of comparative politics increasingly explore the institutional architecture of authoritarian regimes, they should find much of general interest in theoretically informed analyses of specific Southeast Asian countries.},

abstract = {The nature of the political culture itself is often seen by commentators as the cause of democracy failing to take root in China; the antidemocratic elements of that culture being overemphasised while the democratic elements are underemphasised. This paper examines the application of the ideas of democratic culture in China to the current state of play, including the possibility of the democratic card being played by factions within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). There are indeed cultural problems associated with Chinese democratisation such as cultural anomie, unconscious authoritarian personalities, the legacy of egalitarianism, the radical polarisation of Chinese culture, difficulties of institutional compromise and the irrational control of aggression and fear. While the antidemocratic culture is stronger at present than the democratic culture, the new Chinese democratic culture is likely to gather strength in the future.},

One-party regimes have become the most common type of authoritarian rule and have proved to be more stable and to grow faster than other types of authoritarianism. We review the literature on one-party rule and, using data from 1950–2006, suggest four avenues for future research: focusing on autocrats’ ability to simultaneously minimize threats from the elites and from the masses; focusing on the conditions that foster the establishment and the collapse of oneparty regimes and on transitions from one type of authoritarianism to another; focusing on the relationship between authoritarian elections and democratization; and focusing on the global and international forces that influence the spread of one-party rule.},

@article{Dittmer1996,
abstract = {The development of China studies reflects not only the cumulative progress of ''normal'' science and the adventitious availability of particular source materials, but the changing core concerns or leitmotifs of a political system that has undergone several paradigm shifts. During the reform era, there has been a shift from the Maoist emphasis on charismatic leadership and revolutionary momentum to a concern with economic growth and system building. Thus it becomes possible for us to group (domestic) China studies into three subfields: political economy, political sociology, and political structure. Common to all three of them is a shift from top-down, ''strong state'' assumptions to the construction of complex systems at the middle and lower levels.},

@article{Xu2006,
abstract = {The subtle and complex relation between Confucianism and modern democracy has long been a controversial issue, and it is now again becoming a topical issue in the process of political modernization in contemporary China. This paper argues that there are some quite basic early Confucian values and principles that are not only compatible with democracy, but also may become the theoretic foundation of modern democracy in China. Early Confucianism considers 'the people's will' as the direct representative of 'Heaven's will', with which it legitimizes political power. Confucian theory of 'human nature is good' endorses equal potential good for every man. These principles can be used in reasoning towards a system of democracy. In terms of decision-making, the Confucian 'Doctrine of the Mean' accords with certain democratic principles. The independent personality and committed individualism advocated by early Confucianism is a required civic merit in a democratic society. These fundamental Confucian principles, through contemporary hermeneutics, may provide a philosophic grounding for democracy and support the construction of a democratic system with a Chinese dimension. To get democracy rooted in the spirit of traditional Chinese culture will benefit the healthy and smooth development of democracy in China.},

@article{Ross2006b,
abstract = {Realists agree that great powers balance the military power of rising powers, but there is little agreement regarding secondary-state responses to rising powers. First, there are differences regarding whether secondary states balance or accommodate rising powers. Second, there are differences among realists regarding the distinct roles of economic and military factors in secondary-state alignment policies. Third, some scholars argue that state alignments are not necessarily determined by realist variables, but can reflect preferences shaped by intentions, historical experiences, or cultural influences. This paper addresses these issues in balance-of-power theory. Its empirical focus is the impact of the rise of China on secondary-state alignments in East Asia. After examining the complex mix of China's military and economic reach in East Asia, it concludes that secondary-state behavior is sensitive to local variation in the great power capabilities and that secondary states tend to accommodate rather than balance rising powers. It further concludes that economic capabilities alone are insufficient to generate accommodation, so that the political-economy literature should reexamine cases of apparent secondary-state accommodation to economic dependency, sensitive to the presence of military vulnerability on the part these secondary states to proximate great powers. These conclusions suggest that there is nothing sui generis or culturally-determined in East Asian international politics and that realism can explain alignment behavior among East Asian states as well as it does among European states. Research on East Asia's response to China's rise that is sensitive to intra-regional variations in U.S. and Chinese military and economic capabilities also challenges assumptions of an emerging Chinese regional hegemony or of a costly region-wide U.S.-China competition.},

abstract = {China's involvement in Central Asia occupies an under-researched and emerging area of Chinese foreign policy, one which primarily revolves around its attempts to maintain regional stability in and around its periphery, strengthen its energy security in the region and maintain stable relations with the United States. Through its codominance with Russia of the nascent Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), it has and will likely continue to find cooperation with SCO member states over the former two issues, but will encounter some difficulty in finding cooperation regarding the latter. The PRC's relations with Central Asia hold important short- and long-term implications for understanding the role of Xinjiang in China's foreign relations, China's energy security and its relations with the US. Furthermore, SinoCentral Asian relations function as a proving ground for testing the viability of China's grand strategy, effectively articulated by Avery Goldstein, in a specific foreign policy setting. Beijing's Central Asian policies reflect its larger geopolitical strategy, meant to ensure its peaceful rise to regional prominence, assuage fears of a China threat and focus on domestic development. This study concludes that China's relations with Central Asia meet vital national interests in regional stability, energy security and stable US-China relations, while achieving secondary benefits crucial to its grand strategy of a peaceful rise.},

@article{Hughes2005,
abstract = {One of Michael Leifer's main fears for the future role of ASEAN arose from the spectre of a rising nationalistic China. This article assesses whether recent developments have borne out those fears by looking at the nature of Beijing's evolving multilateral approach towards the region. Agreeing with Leifer that nationalism is an important influence on Chinese foreign policy, the article explores the complex relationship between domestic politics and the discourse of multipolarity in China to propose that multilateralism is an effective way for Beijing to increase its regional power while avoiding confrontation with the United States or regional powers like India and Japan. However, Beijing's multilateralism is still premised on hard conceptions of state sovereignty and has to be developed in the context of a nationalistic political culture that prevents the achievement of regional stability through compromise on issues such as the South China Sea disputes and the Taiwan question. China's continuing economic growth also means that its multilateralism in Southeast Asia will unavoidably be shaped by issues such as the role of the ethnic Chinese as economic bridgeheads and the realities of an increasingly asymmetrical balance of power. Meanwhile, the relative economic weakness of the Southeast Asian states also means that nature of ASEAN-style regionalism will continue to be determined by the extra-mural balance of power, with China as one of the major actors, as Michael Leifer predicted.},

abstract = {As frequent, violent, and organized peasant protests show, China's reform regime has lost its once all-powerful control in the countryside. The sharp decline of village cadres' positional authority in allocating economic resources, which began in post-Mao decollectivization, holds the key to explaining the change. Since the late 1990s, the collapse of village enterprises and the erosion of power over land have cost village cadres their remaining economic levers to engage the villagers as well as their incentives to work for the party-state. The loss of the regime's grip on village cadres and the loss of command by village cadres on peasants have almost synchronized, causing the traditional structure of organizational control to crumble in vast rural areas. In the new, prevailing patterns of village governance, party power is becoming increasingly irrelevant.},

Is China a problem case? The author thinks not, or at least that it is too early to tell. China is now following the path of other East Asian countries that have achieved sustained economic growth, established rule of law, and developed constitutional or rights-based democracies, albeit not necessarily liberal rights-based democracies. At this stage of development, for all of its problems, China is meeting or exceeding expectations on most measures. China outperforms the average country in its income class in terms of economic growth, rule of law and most human rights measures, and other indicators of human well-being with the notable exception of civil and political rights.},

Three general theoretical arguments in support of the Lee thesis are then presented. However, the empirical results, based on panel data analysis on more than 20 Asian countries, do not support the hypothesis that dictatorship increases economic growth in Asia. There is no significant, average effect of democracy on growth. Asian dictatorships do invest a larger fraction of their GDP than democracies, but they are worse at generating high enrollment ratios in education after primary school.},

abstract = {Economic development and internal security are the considerations that dominate foreign, security, and military policies of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Beyond these immediate concerns, the Chinese are determined to achieve the international status and influence of a ''great power.'' To achieve that, they are building ''great power'' armed forces. Chinese policies and actions often seem aggressive to their neighbors. Much of this behavior stems from fundamental assumptions about China's special status in Asia. Although Peking (Beijing) denies seeking ''hegemony,'' China's neighbors note the PRC's military doctrine of ''limited and regional wars,'' and the growing power projection capability of the People's Liberation Army (PLA). At the logical extreme of the PRC's ''hegemonist'' aspiration is a willingness to intervene militarily if a neighbor's behavior goes ''out of bounds,'' or if it gets too close to an outside power. The PRC's treatment of Vietnam is a prime example, as is its more recent policy toward Mongolia. The Chinese sincerely want to be friendly and cooperative. However, they assume that they should be the dominant regional power, and that other powers, including the United States, should recognize and defer to their regional interests. The Japanese are their only strong rival for regional hegemony. Accordingly, PLA officers regard Japan as a long-term military threat, while others in the region fear a Sino-Japanese arms race.},

@article{Orban2003,
abstract = {This article compares the practice of great power federalism in terms of global/local economic policy and relations in a context of expanding regional influence and transcontinental reach. The authors contrast China's recent decentralization experience with that of the FRG and the United States with respect to management of productive ventures, regulation of the economy, trade and commerce, fiscal relations, monetary policy and labor mobility. The three great-power states manage their complex and far-reaching economies-through systems of multi-level governance that exhibit elements of convergence at the same time as each is headed in a defining direction. German federalism is making room for supranational involvement, US federalism emphasizes new managerialism at all levels of government and China's post Mao de facto federalism is launching provincial and sub-provincial governments on a booming economic trajectory. China's recent performance is particularly impressive given the size of its population and the extent to which its economy has been transformed and energized. In key respects, China's administrative system is the most decentralized and fluid. The effective participation of Chinese sub-national entities in transterritorial economic undertakings is particularly striking. China's experience suggests that the requisite energy and capacity to tackle trans-national economic challenges might lie at the sub-national level. Given the shifting nature of global pressures and local priorities, the extra-organizational sensitivities and linkages of sub-national public managers must include proximate and distant economic conditions, central, government, overseers and trans-national actors. In this dynamic context, the most fluid forms of federalism are likely to have an edge.},

abstract = {This article studies East Asian political economy from a regional perspective. The Asian financial crisis showed that East Asian economies are highly regionalized. However, the linkages among Asian economies, mostly informal in nature, often appear "invisible" to many in the West, who focus more on the states and formal institutions. Drawing on a broad set of literature mostly in Asian languages, this paper provides a systematic study of informal integration in East Asia, which consists of not only regional production networks, but also ethnic Chinese business networks and subregional economic zones. It finds that the three informal mechanisms have formed an interrelated pattern of regional integration in East Asia. The nature of the economic networks is very useful in explaining the Asian crisis and the different performances Of. East. Asian economies in the crisis. The crisis has also resulted in profound changes in informal integration. While the Japanese-led production networks have been greatly weakened, the Chinese Economic Area is rising, driven by the ethnic Chinese business networks and subregional economic zones. As a result, the Japan-dominated "flying geese pattern" has been broken. The connections between Greater China and the United States have also been enhanced and are out-competing the Japanese production networks. Many of the new developments have been ignored in the-Vest but they are key factors that will shape the future of Asian and World political economy.},

abstract = {This paper examines how PRC domestic politics constrains and influences China's Taiwan policy, and thus indirectly affects cross-Strait relations. Specifically, this paper examines six factors: (1) collective leadership and factionalism, (2) succession politics, (3) bureaucratic competition, (4) nationalism, (5) legitimacy crisis and political reform, and (6) central-local and central-minority relations. The impact of these six factors is multiple. In general, they constitute tremendous constraints for any PRC leadership seeking to change the existing policy line. From the perspective of the policy making process, a lack of a transparent, stable, and predictable political structure and policy making process does not allow the regime in general, and individual leaders in particular; much room to take political risks or enjoy flexibility in dealing with Taiwan. From the perspective of the structural characteristic of the whole nation, internally the PRC holds a strong feeling of insecurity in regard to national integrity- i.e., has a vulnerable legitimacy base. Externally speaking, China also suffers from deep frustration in her pursuit of international status, which in turn fuels a strong nationalism. There is thus a strong hawkish bias in the PRCs Taiwan policy, that derives from domestic political factors. In determining whether or not a "Taiwan threat" exists, this paper thus argues that more attention should be paid to the opportunities and challenges presented or imposed by the structural constraints and dynamics of PRC domestic politics.},

abstract = {Most theories that seek to explain democratization look to changes in the economy as the precursor to significant political liberalization, locating the main causal factor in either severe economic crisis or rapid economic growth. In the Chinese context, by contrast, the Communist Party has extricated itself from the socialist social contract with the urban working class without losing its grip on political power. Moreover, China has maintained a rapid pace of economic growth for over twenty-five years without significant political liberalization. Comparative analysis of China's post-1978 reform policies yields insights both across types of socialist transition, comparing China with Eastern Europe and Russia, and across time, comparing China with other high-growth East Asian economics. A key factor in China's ability, to reform the economy without sacrificing political control is the timing and sequencing of its foreign direct investment (FDI) liberalization. There arc two key variables that are important to this comparative analysis: China's pattern of ownership diversification and China's mode of integration into the global economy. The article relates these two variables to the success of economic change without political liberalization, in particular, how FDI liberalization has affected relations between workers and the ruling Communist Party. "Reform and openness" in this context resulted in a strengthened Chinese state, a weakened civil society (especially labor), and a delay in political liberalization.},

This article sets out some of the major analytical questions that emerge when thinking about the foreign policy options of these countries and some of the principal conceptual and theoretical categories within which those questions may be usefully framed. The first section examines the reasons for taking these countries as a group. The second section provides a brief overview of two of the most common theoretical perspectives from which the systemic pressures on these countries have been understood. The third considers their actual and potential strategies and options under five headings: their status as regional powers; their behaviour within and towards international institutions; their relations with the United States; collaboration among them and evidence for the possible emergence of balancing behaviour; and the links between economic development and foreign policy.},

@article{Dent2005,
abstract = {Regional economic relations in East Asia have experienced a period of profound change since the 1997/98 financial crisis. Two developments are particularly notable. The first relates to the ASEAN Plus Three (APT) framework, under which an increasingly coalescent regional economic grouping has emerged in East Asia. Thus far, APT member states (Japan, China, South Korea and the ASEAN group) have devoted much energy to creating new mechanisms of regional financial governance, such as the Chiang Mai Initiative and Asian Bond Market Initiative. The second development concerns the expansion of bilateral free trade agreement (FFA) projects in East Asia and the Asia-Pacific. Many see this as a precursor to forging wider sub-regional or regional trade agreements. Both developments mark a potentially significant shift from regionalization to regionalism in East Asia, and thus "high politics" becomes defacto more important given regionalism is largely founded on inter-(nation-)state agreements. Beijing's continued ardent contestation of Taiwan's nation-statehood has hence limited Taiwan's ability to engage as it would like in East Asia's new regional political economy. This article considers the nature of regional political economy and applies it to the recent East Asian experience, which in turn provides an analytical framework for examining the significance of the APT framework and new FIFA trend, and Taiwan's position in relation to them. Special attention is paid to Taiwan's prospects in East Asia's new regional political economy.},

abstract = {Burma (now officially known as Myanmar)(1) occupies a critical geostrategic position. It is where South Asia, East Asia and Southeast Asia meet. It lies between two regional giants, China and India, with which it shares long and permeable borders populated by rebellious ethnic groups and independent armies. For centuries Burma has offered southern China a trade outlet on the Indian Ocean, and during the Second World War it provided the Allies in India with their only land route to the Nationalist Chinese regime in Chungking. During the anti-communist struggles of the 1950s Burma was considered by the Western democracies to be an Asian 'domino' of as much value as Thailand or Vietnam. Burma's strategic importance declined after 1962, when it withdrew into self-imposed isolation, but since 1988 it has once again emerged as an important factor in regional security calculations. In particular, changes in Burma's relations with China and India, and the resulting shift in the regional power balance, have far-reaching implications. Not surprisingly, analysts examining the complex relationship between China, Burma and India have tended to focus on the roles and concerns of China and India. Because of their greater size and influence in world affairs, these countries have demanded attention in ways that Burma has not. Yet Burma's own policies and unique perspectives cannot be ignored. Indeed, if they are taken fully into account, it is possible to see strategic developments in this part of the world since 1988 from a different and arguably more balanced point of view. Also, if Burma can successfully manage its developing relations with its two largest neighbours, then the regional security outlook may not be quite as uncertain or unstable as some observers have suggested.},

abstract = {The 1998 administrative reforms in China provide a pregnant context for comparative analysis of the "reinventing government" movement. Described in some detail, the reforms are compared with the recent administrative reform experience in the United States. Significant similarities are illuminated using the prisms of ideology, politics, history, bureaucracy, and economics. Insight emerges on the role of experience, leadership, and technical-political expertise in administrative development. The analysis concludes that the art and science of global public administration can be advanced through increased comparative analysis of non-Western developing systems with the more developed Western administrative states.},

abstract = {This article presents a systematic examination of the workplace-based welfare system in urban China. During the pre-reform period from 1949 to 1978, most welfare provisions in China were delivered and the majority of welfare spending was spent by workplace units. Since China's market transition started in the late 1970s, this workplace-based welfare system is no longer financially sustainable, and more importantly its functioning constitutes an impediment to the formation of an institutional configuration for a market economy in China. The Chinese government has therefore experienced increasing pressure to reshape this workplace-based welfare system into a genuine welfare state, so as to shift the responsibilities of welfare provisions from individual work units to government bodies. Some institutional arrangements characteristic of welfare pluralism, which emphasize that the state, employers, and individuals share welfare responsibilities, are also incorporated into the newly emergent social welfare system in urban China.

abstract = {With the breakup of its mentor and protector the Soviet Union, Mongolia is confronted with very difficult policy choices indeed. In the changed circumstances, given Moscow's inability to act as the guardian of Mongolia's economic and strategic interests and given Mongolia's historical suspicions about China's irredentist ambitions, Ulan Bator has been forced to look for new and reliable economic and security partners in the post-Soviet Union, post-Cold War world. Ulan Bator is struggling to come to terms with the realities of the new geopolitical environment and exploring the opportunities for closer ties with the outside world beyond the narrow geopolitical confines of location between Russia and China so as to ensure both national independence and economic survival. Consequently, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Western Europe, the ASEAN countries, Kazakhstan, and even India have come to occupy a prominent place on Mongolian foreign policy agenda. The country is also witnessing a marked reemergence of Mongol nationalism. Buddhist religion is once again blooming in Mongolia. This article argues that during the last seven decades of Mongolia's existence as a nation-state, geography, history, politics and economics forced a preoccupation with the neighboring giants in its north and south-the Soviet Union and China-and discouraged contacts with the countries in the east and west. The Mongol fear of annexation and absorption by its large, powerful neighboring giants has played a decisive role in the shaping of Mongolia's worldview and external outlook in the 20th century. However, the collapse of the Soviet Union has afforded Ulan Bator the opportunity, for the first time in this century, to look east (Japan and South Korea) and west (the US, Europe and nearer home, Kazakhstan) to balance its relations with countries in the north and south (Russia and China). Mongolian strategic experts and policy makers have called upon the world to pay more attention to their country which could serve as a bulwark to Chinese and Russian expansion in the heartland of Asia. Mongolia's national interests lie in seeing to it that it does not once again become a bone of contention between Moscow and Beijing. Following the collapse of the Russian power, Mongolia has legitimate fears about an increasingly powerful China's intentions to supplant the former Soviet Union as the dominant power on Mongolia's borders. Relations with its southern neighbor are on a more even keel, yet major differences with Beijing remain, given the fact that many Chinese still consider Mongolia to be ''Chinese territory.'' However, the threat to Mongolia's security and independence in the short to medium terms is clearly more economic than military in nature. With the weight of population and cash on Chinese side, there is a possibility that first capital/technology transfers and then population transfer could make Mongolia highly dependent on its southern neighbor. Therefore, Ulan Bator seeks to reduce its economic dependence on its neighboring giants. It goes without saying that Mongolia cannot possibly hope to cope on its own with the entire spectrum of threats-military, economic and ideological to-its security. That is why the Mongol leaders are stressing the need to integrate their country with the international economic and political system and to strengthen interaction with the developed and developing countries at international forums. Ulan Bator should be offered all the help it requires in its hour of need as Mongolia is the first and so far the only former communist country in Asia to attempt a simultaneous transition to democracy and a market economy.},

abstract = {The information overload in learning and teaching scenarios is a main hindering factor for efficient and effective learning. New methods are needed to help teachers and students in dealing with the vast amount of available information and learning material. Our approach aims to utilize contextualized attention metadata to capture behavioural information of users in learning contexts that can be used to deal with the information overload in user centric ways. We introduce a schema and framework for capturing and managing such contextualized attention metadata in this paper. Schema and framework are designed to enable collecting and merging observations about the attention users give to content and their contexts. The contextualized attention metadata schema enables the correlation of the observations, thus reflects the relationships that exists between the user, her context and the content she works with. We illustrate with a simple demo application how contextualized attention metadata can be collected from several tools, the merging of the data streams into a repository and finally the correlation of the data.},

abstract = {There can be no doubt that the aggregate gains China has derived from its open-door policy have outweighed the aggregate costs. Such gains and costs are, however, not evenly distributed. This article examines whether the government is capable of compensating the losers through taxing the winners. While not denying the constraints that this economic reform policy has placed on the range of choices available to domestic policymakers, the case of China shows that the state is by no means helpless in the face of the forces of globalization. China can certainly compensate the losers of its open-door policy if its government chooses to do so. However, were the government to capitulate to the "structural power" of global capital, and to turn a blind eye to hardship caused by its liberalization policy, then the uneven distribution of the gains and costs of greater openness could trigger and exacerbate distributive conflicts between the winners and losers, and eventually derail China's market reforms and imperil its future growth.},

@article{Guo1998,
abstract = {The central question in this article is why the democratic transition that occurred in the former Soviet Union failed to occur in post-Mao China, a question that has rarely been fully studied in a comparative and systematic way. The first half of the article seeks to solve the methodological problem in comparative research that has limited the ability of social scientists to identify a set of causal variables that shaped contrasting outcomes in the political transition of China and the Soviet Union. In analyzing regime transitions involving small-n cases, this article adopts the most similar systems design to minimize the problem of causal overdetermination. In so doing, a comprehensive and multi:causal analytical framework of variables is developed and used to formulate a set of hypotheses and explore the causal connections between the key forces and the transition outcome. The second half of the article seeks to provide a systematic, comprehensive, and multi-causal comparison of China and the Soviet Union to capture the whole of the reality of political transition. in contrast to prior studies that have been too narrow to answer the research question, the analysis oft he six hypothesized relationships in this article offers an adequate causal explanation for the variation in transition outcome and also makes it possible to predict regime change in post-Deng China.},

In the context of conflict studies, economic data are frequently unavailable for states involved in conflicts, undermining the ability to drawinferences of linkages between economic and political interactions. For example, simply using available data in a study of trade and conflict and disregarding observations with missing data on economic variables excludes key conflicts such as the Berlin crisis, the KoreanWar, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the GulfWar from the sample. Aset of procedures are presented to create additional estimates to remedy some of the coverage problems for data on gross domestic product, population, and bilateral trade flows.},

abstract = {Realists agree that great powers balance the military power of rising powers, but there is little agreement regarding secondary-state responses to rising powers. First, there are differences regarding whether secondary states balance or accommodate rising powers. Second, there are differences among realists regarding the distinct roles of economic and military factors in secondary-state alignment policies. Third, some scholars argue that state alignments are not necessarily determined by realist variables, but can reflect preferences shaped by intentions, historical experiences, or cultural influences. This paper addresses these issues in balance-of-power theory. Its empirical focus is the impact of the rise of China on secondary-state alignments in East Asia. After examining the complex mix of China's military and economic reach in East Asia, it concludes that secondary-state behavior is sensitive to local variation in the great power capabilities and that secondary states tend to accommodate rather than balance rising powers. It further concludes that economic capabilities alone are insufficient to generate accommodation, so that the political-economy literature should reexamine cases of apparent secondary-state accommodation to economic dependency, sensitive to the presence of military vulnerability on the part these secondary states to proximate great powers. These conclusions suggest that there is nothing sui generis or culturally-determined in East Asian international politics and that realism can explain alignment behavior among East Asian states as well as it does among European states. Research on East Asia's response to China's rise that is sensitive to intra-regional variations in U.S. and Chinese military and economic capabilities also challenges assumptions of an emerging Chinese regional hegemony or of a costly region-wide U.S.-China competition.},

abstract = {Modern constitutionalism, with its principles of separation of powers, checks and balances, and popularly-elected Congress and officials, is unknown to traditional China. It was introduced to China in the late nineteenth century. Between 1912 and 1945, various versions of constitution were enacted and drafted, but it was not until December 25, 1946, that a formal democratic constitution was adopted by the popularly-elected National Assembly, which entered into force on December 25, 1947. The defeat of Republican forces by the Chinese Communist forces in the 1946-49 Chinese civil war and the removal of the Republic of China (ROC) government to Taiwan in late 1949 ended the operation of this constitution on the mainland; but in Taiwan this constitution has been continued in force. Because of the Chinese Communist threat to take over Taiwan by force, martial law was proclaimed in 1949, extraordinary powers were granted to the President by the Temporary Provisions enacted by the National Assembly, and elections for national elective bodies-the National Assembly, the Legislative Yuan, and the Control Yuan-were suspended. With the reduction of tension in the Taiwan Strait since the late 1970s, the ROC government gradually restored full constitutional rule. Martial law was lifted in July 1987 and the ban on organizing political parties was abolished. On April 23, 1991, the Extraordinary Session of the National Assembly adopted Additional Articles of the Constitution of the ROC, which make all members of the national elective bodies be periodically elected in Taiwan. On December 21, 1991, the Second National Assembly election was held and the Assembly in 1992 adopted more Additional Articles of the Constitution to strengthen democracy in the ROC, but the Assembly could not decide on the method of electing the President of the Republic-by electoral college or popular election, which will be decided in an extraordinary session of the National Assembly to be convened by the President before 1995. With these reforms the ROC is now a full-fledged democracy.},

abstract = {Western historiography on the idea of freedom in modern China has tended to focus on its conception as service to the state and social ends, as illustrated by studies of Liang Qichao's democratic thought; as a result, many other interpretations have been overlooked. This article locates Chinese notions of liberty in a broader context as a fusion of personal, national, social, civic, and moral freedoms. After revisiting Liang Qichao's conception of freedom, it posits six others that are mutually interactive-freedom as liberation; as self-development, independent personality, and responsibility; as democracy and human rights; as a spiritual cultural necessity; as a private realm; and as autonomy and self-mastery. The article offers a more nuanced understanding of the issue of the primacy of collective interests over individual interests by developing the notion of dual responsibilities, or the dualism between the sanctity of personal liberty and the public morality of service to society and state.},

abstract = {China's economic growth and transition pose fascinating questions for social scientists. In the economic realm, proponents of the market-preserving federalism (MPF) model appear to have gone too far. In reality, China's central leadership has retained the prerogative to appoint top provincial officials as well as the power to reconfigure central-provincial fiscal relations, thus defying predictions of the MPF model. In the social realm, rapid growth has propelled the expansion of the middle class, but the large increase in inequality has sharpened social cleavages and class conflicts. The uncertainties of market transition and rising social conflicts pose major challenges for the ruling elite and for China's political development.},

@article{Chiu1993a,
abstract = {Modern constitutionalism, with its principles of separation of powers, checks and balances, and popularly-elected Congress and officials, is unknown to traditional China. It was introduced to China in the late nineteenth century. Between 1912 and 1945, various versions of constitution were enacted and drafted, but it was not until December 25, 1946, that a formal democratic constitution was adopted by the popularly-elected National Assembly, which entered into force on December 25, 1947. The defeat of Republican forces by the Chinese Communist forces in the 1946-49 Chinese civil war and the removal of the Republic of China (ROC) government to Taiwan in late 1949 ended the operation of this constitution on the mainland; but in Taiwan this constitution has been continued in force. Because of the Chinese Communist threat to take over Taiwan by force, martial law was proclaimed in 1949, extraordinary powers were granted to the President by the Temporary Provisions enacted by the National Assembly, and elections for national elective bodies-the National Assembly, the Legislative Yuan, and the Control Yuan-were suspended. With the reduction of tension in the Taiwan Strait since the late 1970s, the ROC government gradually restored full constitutional rule. Martial law was lifted in July 1987 and the ban on organizing political parties was abolished. On April 23, 1991, the Extraordinary Session of the National Assembly adopted Additional Articles of the Constitution of the ROC, which make all members of the national elective bodies be periodically elected in Taiwan. On December 21, 1991, the Second National Assembly election was held and the Assembly in 1992 adopted more Additional Articles of the Constitution to strengthen democracy in the ROC, but the Assembly could not decide on the method of electing the President of the Republic-by electoral college or popular election, which will be decided in an extraordinary session of the National Assembly to be convened by the President before 1995. With these reforms the ROC is now a full-fledged democracy.},

abstract = {The constitution of the Republic of China (ROC) has been in effect since December 25, 1947, although many of its provisions were frozen after the retreat of the Nationalist government from mainland China to Taiwan in 1949. Since the Taipei government launched its liberalization and democratization movement in the mid-1980s, the subject of revising the constitution to suit the new political reality in Taiwan has been widely discussed. After a series of political crises, the government decided to set 1992 as the year of constitutional reform, and the major political parties in Taiwan have put great effort into promoting their respective reform proposals. Although people in Taiwan had high expectations that the general institutional outlook of the central government could be improved and further constitutional crises could be prevented, the results of the constitutional revision in the first half of 1992 did not meet with those expectations. One can reasonably anticipate that further debate and conflict may stem from the new constitutional setup.},

abstract = {The issue of China's Northeast Project is minor when juxtaposed against other important problems in Northeast Asia. However, this issue is more than a simple matter of historical interpretation. The Northeast Project dispute between Korea and China involves many factors, including that of national sovereignty and the balance of power in Northeast Asia. Many Korean scholars insist that the Northeast Project was just an effort to promote "historical hegemony" in a systematic and organized manner by the Chinese government. They believe that China is distorting the history of Goguryeo (Koguryo) in order to secure preemptive lights in the region in preparation for the collapse of North Korea. But, in order for this analysis to be justified, a comprehensive study should be undertaken to determine the role and intent of the Chinese central government regarding the Northeast Project, and China's policy towards Northeast Asia and the Korean peninsula. Though the political implications of the Northeast Project have been amplified beyond objective facts, it is hard to deny that China has begun adjusting to the existing realities in the Korean peninsula through the Northeast Project. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a scholarly basis for a foreign policy that separates historical sovereignty from territorial sovereignty. Another solution is to spread and deepen the Korean-Chinese historical discourse.},

abstract = {In China, as in other parts of the world, the perceived mal-manifestations of globalization have led to the rise of anti-globalization movement among intellectuals. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether globalization is linked to social conflict in China, as perceived by the anti-globalists. It argues that globalization per se does not lead to social conflict, and the state functions as an intervening variable between globalization and social conflict. The Chinese state has played a proactive role in promoting globalization, and introduced various reform programs to integrate the country with the rest of the world. These reforms have benefited China. Nevertheless, while the state has been successful in implementing "external reforms," it has not been able (or failed) to initiate and implement "internal reforms." The gap between "external reform" and "internal reform" has made it difficult for China to cope with some of the "negative effects" of globalization, thus leading to the rise of social conflict.},

abstract = {China is establishing an econdmic and military position in Burma that strengthens it vis-a-vis both India and Southeast Asia and improves its access to the Indian Ocean. The transportation network China is helping establish in Burma has economic value for both countries, but may also serve strategic purposes. Such developments and Burma's dependence on China are contrary to US interests, but US policy toward Burma has focused on moral symbolism and neglected development of a policy that would encourage real change. US policy is equally ineffective in countering Chinese influence, encouraging democratization and stopping human rights abuses. India and Thailand especially are concerned about China's growing influence. India has been moving with increasing urgency to reengage with Burma and counter Chinese influence. The US should also take steps to reengage the Burmese government, gain leverage in the economy and try to coordinate a common policy toward Burma with Europe, Japan, India and ASEAN. The focus should be on realistic incremental change rather than the system transformation many in the West seem to hope for. Changes in US policy would increase US effectiveness in moving Burma toward a more democratic polity that would promulgate a foreign policy more typical of Southeast Asian countries and more compatible with US interests.},

abstract = {The article presents an analysis of the post-Cold War dynamics of power-balancing between the United States and China, and the role great powers and middle powers such as ASEAN Russia, South Korea, Japan and India play in this process. It makes a contribution to the ongoing debate on the U.S.-China relationship by showing how divergent U.S.-China policies in key areas such as anti-terror and anti-WMD initiatives, democracy and human rights, the U.S. alliance system and the UN system contribute to unstable patterns of power balancing in the Asia-Pacific. The article argues that the main flaws in Chinese policies on Asia-Pacific security come to the fore in Northeast Asia, which is a stronghold of the U.S. alliance system and China's near abroad, thus affecting China's influence on global security. If China cannot accommodate the region into its overall foreign policy strategy, its suggestions for a post-Cold War security order are likely to appear unconvincing to the international community. The article points out that the main flaws in U.S. policies on Asia-Pacific security come to the fore in Southeast, Central and South Asia, where Washington's concerns to preserve its pre-eminence prompts it to compromise on core foreign policy principles such as its anti-WMD measures and its policies on the political legitimacy of regimes. These flaws encourage the majority of regional states to extend partial support to the Chinese version of regional order without departing from the U.S. security umbrella. The article concludes that Sino-U.S. policies on the regional order result in patterns of power-balancing not underpinned by coexistence, an order that may be called "stable instability," because it is likely to remain in place as the regional order of the Asia-Pacific for the foreseeable future.},

@article{Kim2001a,
abstract = {This paper centers on elaborating a sequence path of the forty years of the Sino-North Korean alliance by employing several standards that explain why alliances endure or collapse. The sequence path began when China's threat perceptions began changing in the early 1970s. The next stage witnessed significant decline in China's credibility as an alliance partner As a result, the third stage showed North Korea's increasing secondary alliance dilemma that was further stimulated by the collapse of the communist world and the end of the Cold War As a solution, North Korea bandwagoned with the United States. The final picture of this ongoing sequence path has appeared with North Korea's maneuvering between Washington and Beijing, as well as China's attempts to preserve its traditional sphere of influence against encroachment by the United States. This paper concludes that the alliance is being transformed from an ideological military alliance to a new triangular security relationship between North Korea, China, and the United States. In accordance, North Korea is becoming increasingly autonomous in its alliance with China. In so doing, Pyongyang is attempting to play one superpower off against the other much as it succeeded in doing with the former Soviet Union and China. China, in turn, is compelled to defend its traditional sphere of geopolitical influence. North Korea will be involved in the corning conflict between China and the United States during the twenty-first century.},

abstract = {Is China moving toward hegemonic ambitions in Asia and the world, or is it a benign state naturally expanding its interests as its power grows? The question prompts major debates among China specialists around the world. This paper joins the debate by examining China's most critical security relationships to see what they reveal about the PRC's ambitions. This paper begins with the widely accepted assumption that national economic development will continue to be China's most important objective into the early twenty-first century. Economic modernization conditions, colors, and prompts most other PRC policies. Accordingly, as the PRC enters the twenty-first century bordering fourteen other countries (five of them nuclear armed or believed to be nuclear capable), China's leadership wants a stable and tranquil external environment with which to work and one not dominated by any single power nor set of security alliances. The paper examines in turn PRC security relations with Russia, Japan, Europe, the two Koreas, Southeast Asia, South Asia, the US, and Taiwan. The burgeoning Sino-Russian arms connection, the PRC's periodic tensions with Japan and India, the mixed conflict and cooperation with the US, and Beijing's strategy toward Taipei are all treated. The study concludes that in each case (including Taiwan) Chinese policy reflects a general conservativeness and caution. Thus the American foreign policy approach toward China of "engagement" makes sense. Nationalism, however, is now a powerful force in Chinese policies in the post-Deng era. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that China will permanently continue its cautious approach towards international security.},

abstract = {China's involvement in Central Asia occupies an under-researched and emerging area of Chinese foreign policy, one which primarily revolves around its attempts to maintain regional stability in and around its periphery, strengthen its energy security in the region and maintain stable relations with the United States. Through its codominance with Russia of the nascent Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), it has and will likely continue to find cooperation with SCO member states over the former two issues, but will encounter some difficulty in finding cooperation regarding the latter. The PRC's relations with Central Asia hold important short- and long-term implications for understanding the role of Xinjiang in China's foreign relations, China's energy security and its relations with the US. Furthermore, SinoCentral Asian relations function as a proving ground for testing the viability of China's grand strategy, effectively articulated by Avery Goldstein, in a specific foreign policy setting. Beijing's Central Asian policies reflect its larger geopolitical strategy, meant to ensure its peaceful rise to regional prominence, assuage fears of a China threat and focus on domestic development. This study concludes that China's relations with Central Asia meet vital national interests in regional stability, energy security and stable US-China relations, while achieving secondary benefits crucial to its grand strategy of a peaceful rise.},

abstract = {Nepal has been one of the regular and first recipients of Chinese aid. Ever since the resumption of diplomatic relations in 1955, China's relations with Nepal have been generally friendly. Due to the connections between Nepal and Tibet in the past and the former's geographic location, China considers Nepal a country of strategic importance. This was particularly so during the Cold War years. China has had three major foreign policy interests in Nepal over the years-strategic, political, and economic. This article examines these major policy motivations for China's aid to Nepal and postulates certain implications far China's aid policy in the post-Cold War period. The article concludes that China's aid has generally been successful in maintaining its strategic interests and countering the influence of India and other powers in Nepal, and that although superpower interests in Nepal may have been diminished in the post-Cold WI. years, China's interest in Nepal will remain vital sc, long as ifs position in Tibet remains unchanged. This implies that China will continue its politics of aid to Nepal in order to maintain the latter's commitment to supporting the former's position in Tibet.},

abstract = {China is commonly assumed to be seeking hegemony in its region. Yet China's region involves it in relationships with major states with their own hegemonic or leadership interests-the US, Russia, Japan and India. This article examines each of China's regional relationships in terms of the prime interests of China's foreign policy framework. It concludes that it is important to distinguish between hegemonic capabilities and intentions: that while China will want to extend its influence as a regional power, its capability to do that will continue to grow in each of its subregions, its ability to exercise that power and influence will be limited. In the past its efforts have been largely to seek secure borders and economic opportunities and that for some years those objectives, together with energy security, are likely to remain the priority.},

@article{Hughes2005a,
abstract = {One of Michael Leifer's main fears for the future role of ASEAN arose from the spectre of a rising nationalistic China. This article assesses whether recent developments have borne out those fears by looking at the nature of Beijing's evolving multilateral approach towards the region. Agreeing with Leifer that nationalism is an important influence on Chinese foreign policy, the article explores the complex relationship between domestic politics and the discourse of multipolarity in China to propose that multilateralism is an effective way for Beijing to increase its regional power while avoiding confrontation with the United States or regional powers like India and Japan. However, Beijing's multilateralism is still premised on hard conceptions of state sovereignty and has to be developed in the context of a nationalistic political culture that prevents the achievement of regional stability through compromise on issues such as the South China Sea disputes and the Taiwan question. China's continuing economic growth also means that its multilateralism in Southeast Asia will unavoidably be shaped by issues such as the role of the ethnic Chinese as economic bridgeheads and the realities of an increasingly asymmetrical balance of power. Meanwhile, the relative economic weakness of the Southeast Asian states also means that nature of ASEAN-style regionalism will continue to be determined by the extra-mural balance of power, with China as one of the major actors, as Michael Leifer predicted.},

In the meantime, Chinese economic model has gain wide recognition and praise worldwide. Joshua C. Ramo coined the term of Beijing Consensus as an alternative approach to economic development for developing nations. There has been hot debate on the notion of Beijing Consensus. We argue even though there are some problems in Ramo’s original definition of Beijing Consensus, we should not reject this notion altogether. Instead, we should try to come up with better conceptualizations of this term. In this paper, we sum up ten general principles of the Chinese development model as our new definition of the Beijing Consensus.},

abstract = {Many scholars attribute China's market reforms and the remarkable economic performance they have fostered in part to the country's political and fiscal decentralization. Political decentralization is said to have stimulated local policy experiments and restrained predatory central interventions. Fiscal decentralization is thought to have motivated local officials to promote development and harden enterprises' budget constraints. The locally diversified structure of the prereform economy is said to have facilitated liberalization. Reexamining these arguments, the authors find that none establishes a convincing link between political or fiscal decentralization and China's successes. They suggest an alternative view of the reform process in which growth-enhancing policies emerged from competition between promarket and conservative factions in Beijing.},

abstract = {The subtle and complex relation between Confucianism and modern democracy has long been a controversial issue, and it is now again becoming a topical issue in the process of political modernization in contemporary China. This paper argues that there are some quite basic early Confucian values and principles that are not only compatible with democracy, but also may become the theoretic foundation of modern democracy in China. Early Confucianism considers 'the people's will' as the direct representative of 'Heaven's will', with which it legitimizes political power. Confucian theory of 'human nature is good' endorses equal potential good for every man. These principles can be used in reasoning towards a system of democracy. In terms of decision-making, the Confucian 'Doctrine of the Mean' accords with certain democratic principles. The independent personality and committed individualism advocated by early Confucianism is a required civic merit in a democratic society. These fundamental Confucian principles, through contemporary hermeneutics, may provide a philosophic grounding for democracy and support the construction of a democratic system with a Chinese dimension. To get democracy rooted in the spirit of traditional Chinese culture will benefit the healthy and smooth development of democracy in China.},

abstract = {China's aspirations of becoming a world power are well-stated. Consistent with this goal, China is seeking to enhance and maintain military power credible with such a position. Until it is able to complete this process and concurrently stabilize its economy and internal polity, China will continue to seek a period of peace and tranquility. However, its long-term strategy is clearly to become the dominant economic and military power in Asia mid cognizable player in the world. China professes a policy of peace and friendliness toward India. However, it has been creating a ring of anti-Indian influences aimed at the strategic marginalization of India. China's relations with the United States are marked by competition over influence in Asia-Pacific region. However, its strong economic linkages with the United States are likely to cushion adverse impact of irritants in their relations. China is also improving its relations with Russia with a view to obtain technology, arms and perhaps, strategic support against US hegemony. Chinese foreign policy demonstrates pragmatic linkages between its domestic priorities and external conduct. However, its growing stakes in the world will tend to make it behave in an increasingly benign manner. A revamped foreign policy will optimize India's relations with China as indeed with the rest of the world.},

abstract = {Although there is a body of research regarding the development of village self-governance in China, there is only limited research regarding the activity of international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in relation to this development. The paper fills this gap through an analysis of the activities and effects of the village self-governance programs of three American-based NGOs: the International Republican Institute (IRI), the Carter Center and the Ford Foundation. These NGOs have assisted in the implementation of a number of reforms to village self-governance in China. NGO involvement in village democracy in China exemplifies a process of 'political globalisation' that involves the intermingling of layers of power and interests at the national and international levels. The paper concludes that, through this process of political globalisation, rural political reforms in China are both promoted and exploited by national and international political actors.},

abstract = {The development of a more autonomous civil society and a public sphere in the reforming state socialist regimes of Hungary and China occurred through the conflictual and cooperative interaction between state and society. Specifically, the process of development of a civil society was influenced by the pattern of coalitions among groups within society and the political establishment, both of which became more pluralistic during the course of reform. A coalition of reformers in the Communist party leadership and moderates in the protest movement enabled the emergence of democracy in Hungary, whereas the absence of such a coalition resulted in the Tiananmen crisis and the postponement of further political reform in China.},

Yet China's region involves it in relationships with major states with their own hegemonic or leadership interests-the US, Russia, Japan and India. This article examines each of China's regional relationships in terms of the prime interests of China's foreign policy framework. It concludes that it is important to distinguish between hegemonic capabilities and intentions: that while China will want to extend its influence as a regional power, its capability to do that will continue to grow in each of its subregions, its ability to exercise that power and influence will be limited. In the past its efforts have been largely to seek secure borders and economic opportunities and that for some years those objectives, together with energy security, are likely to remain the priority.},

@article{Mikheev1997,
abstract = {This article deals with analysis of the Russia-China strategic cooperation formula announced in the Russian-Chinese political declaration signed last April in Moscow. The formula aroused many questions: What could it mean? How realistic is the "strategic cooperation" idea? What might be its impact on global and regional security? A modern history of the development of the relationship between Russia and China does not present obvious answers to these questions. After the 1989 formal normalization of Russian-Chinese relations, there appeared ideas about strategic technological cooperation in a new triangle: Russia, China and South Korea. However, these were nothing more than ideas. After the collapse of the USSR, Russian diplomacy gave priority to its relations with the West, leaving aside cooperation with China. In 1993-1994 Russia corrected its approach to China: China was named "a perspective partner" and "a great prosperous neighbor." In 1995-1997 Moscow began to look at China in the light of the Russian-American dispute over NATO enlargement eastward and growing dissatisfaction with Western "insufficient" economic assistance (as they think in Moscow) for Russian reforms. The concepts that China is a "more reliable" and "easy-to-talk-to" partner than the West and that Russia should develop a "strategic cooperation" partnership with China were added to the Russian foreign-policy arsenal. The main goal of the article is to examine the conception of Russian-Chinese strategic cooperation from different standpoints. This is to analyze Russian and Chinese approaches to their bilateral strategic cooperation, objective possibilities and resources, as well as impediments to the strategic cooperation, and, finally, to present various scenarios of the strategic cooperation. The article tries to explain what really stands behind the idea of Russian-Chinese strategic cooperation, political bluffing or something pragmatic, and whether other countries should fear Russian-Chinese strategic cooperation and consider countermeasures, or feel it is necessary. The article tries to prove that Russian-Chinese strategic cooperation in its military-political, economic, historical, and ecological aspects, is an illusion today. Both Russia and China clearly understand that their, hypothetically imagined, military-political strategic cooperation would increase tensions in the Asia Pacific-and to some extent worldwide-and they are more inclined to speculate on such an idea in international relations than be able to do anything substantial. The article argues that, hypothetically, economic, ecological, and historical scenarios of Russian-Chinese strategic cooperation could contribute to regional and global security and co-prosperity, as well as to the creation of economic and civilization basis for a unified world. Nowadays, however, it is too early to think seriously about such kind of perspectives. The most likely is a variant of restricted strategic cooperation, which means maintaining normal, good-neighborhood security relations and development of mutually beneficial economic and military-trade relations.},

@article{Guang2005,
abstract = {Conventional understandings of Chinese nationalism often portray it as anti-Western,focusing on Chinese nationalists' obsession with a powerful state and on their ambition to recover the glory of China's historical empire. Such understandings clearly underlie the fear and hostility toward rising Chinese nationalism today. But this view relies too heavily on China's conflictive relations with the West and overemphasizes the impact of China's unique history, culture, and politics, making it hard, if not impossible, to draw on the concept of nationalism in understanding China's relations with its non-Western neighbors. Such a perspective neglects the importance of ideas and ideals from the international system that animate Chinese nationalism. In this article, the author characterizes Chinese nationalism as fusing realpolitik ideas and ideals and a fervent quest for national identity and power A realpolitik nationalist, as defined here, is someone who frames an external threat to China in terms not of the country's unique culture or history but of a breach of the prevailing norms of the nation-state system, whose key dimensions include sovereignty, territoriality, and international legitimacy. Finally, the author applies this notion in examining China's conflicts with India in 1962 and with the Southeast Asian countries involved in the dispute over the Spratly Islands.},

In the emerging Semantic Web, search, interpretation and aggregation can be addressed by ontology-based semantic mark-up. In this paper, we examine semantic annotation, identify a number of requirements, and review the current generation of semantic annotation systems. This analysis shows that, while there is still some way to go before semantic annotation tools will be able to address fully all the knowledge management needs, research in the area is active and making good progress.},

abstract = {Burma (now officially known as Myanmar)(1) occupies a critical geostrategic position. It is where South Asia, East Asia and Southeast Asia meet. It lies between two regional giants, China and India, with which it shares long and permeable borders populated by rebellious ethnic groups and independent armies. For centuries Burma has offered southern China a trade outlet on the Indian Ocean, and during the Second World War it provided the Allies in India with their only land route to the Nationalist Chinese regime in Chungking. During the anti-communist struggles of the 1950s Burma was considered by the Western democracies to be an Asian 'domino' of as much value as Thailand or Vietnam. Burma's strategic importance declined after 1962, when it withdrew into self-imposed isolation, but since 1988 it has once again emerged as an important factor in regional security calculations. In particular, changes in Burma's relations with China and India, and the resulting shift in the regional power balance, have far-reaching implications. Not surprisingly, analysts examining the complex relationship between China, Burma and India have tended to focus on the roles and concerns of China and India. Because of their greater size and influence in world affairs, these countries have demanded attention in ways that Burma has not. Yet Burma's own policies and unique perspectives cannot be ignored. Indeed, if they are taken fully into account, it is possible to see strategic developments in this part of the world since 1988 from a different and arguably more balanced point of view. Also, if Burma can successfully manage its developing relations with its two largest neighbours, then the regional security outlook may not be quite as uncertain or unstable as some observers have suggested.},

@article{Malik1995a,
abstract = {With the breakup of its mentor and protector the Soviet Union, Mongolia is confronted with very difficult policy choices indeed. In the changed circumstances, given Moscow's inability to act as the guardian of Mongolia's economic and strategic interests and given Mongolia's historical suspicions about China's irredentist ambitions, Ulan Bator has been forced to look for new and reliable economic and security partners in the post-Soviet Union, post-Cold War world. Ulan Bator is struggling to come to terms with the realities of the new geopolitical environment and exploring the opportunities for closer ties with the outside world beyond the narrow geopolitical confines of location between Russia and China so as to ensure both national independence and economic survival. Consequently, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Western Europe, the ASEAN countries, Kazakhstan, and even India have come to occupy a prominent place on Mongolian foreign policy agenda. The country is also witnessing a marked reemergence of Mongol nationalism. Buddhist religion is once again blooming in Mongolia. This article argues that during the last seven decades of Mongolia's existence as a nation-state, geography, history, politics and economics forced a preoccupation with the neighboring giants in its north and south-the Soviet Union and China-and discouraged contacts with the countries in the east and west. The Mongol fear of annexation and absorption by its large, powerful neighboring giants has played a decisive role in the shaping of Mongolia's worldview and external outlook in the 20th century. However, the collapse of the Soviet Union has afforded Ulan Bator the opportunity, for the first time in this century, to look east (Japan and South Korea) and west (the US, Europe and nearer home, Kazakhstan) to balance its relations with countries in the north and south (Russia and China). Mongolian strategic experts and policy makers have called upon the world to pay more attention to their country which could serve as a bulwark to Chinese and Russian expansion in the heartland of Asia. Mongolia's national interests lie in seeing to it that it does not once again become a bone of contention between Moscow and Beijing. Following the collapse of the Russian power, Mongolia has legitimate fears about an increasingly powerful China's intentions to supplant the former Soviet Union as the dominant power on Mongolia's borders. Relations with its southern neighbor are on a more even keel, yet major differences with Beijing remain, given the fact that many Chinese still consider Mongolia to be ''Chinese territory.'' However, the threat to Mongolia's security and independence in the short to medium terms is clearly more economic than military in nature. With the weight of population and cash on Chinese side, there is a possibility that first capital/technology transfers and then population transfer could make Mongolia highly dependent on its southern neighbor. Therefore, Ulan Bator seeks to reduce its economic dependence on its neighboring giants. It goes without saying that Mongolia cannot possibly hope to cope on its own with the entire spectrum of threats-military, economic and ideological to-its security. That is why the Mongol leaders are stressing the need to integrate their country with the international economic and political system and to strengthen interaction with the developed and developing countries at international forums. Ulan Bator should be offered all the help it requires in its hour of need as Mongolia is the first and so far the only former communist country in Asia to attempt a simultaneous transition to democracy and a market economy.},

abstract = {Throughout the world, diverse countries are implementing programs of decentralization as a means of promoting both democratic and developmental objectives. Unfortunately, however, scholarship has yet to offer a comprehensive framework within which to assess and reform central-local relations. This article seeks to overcome the "division of labor" that has long separated analyses of administrative and political structures, and to provide stronger conceptual vocabulary for describing and analyzing the complexities of centralization and decentralization in both administration and politics. After developing two distinct continua of administrative and political centralization/decentralization, the paper then combines them in a single matrix able to highlight the wide range of strategies and outcomes that emerge from the complex interplay of the two spheres. Depending on where a country lies within the matrix, it is argued, strategies of decentralization are especially problematic in settings with strong local bosses, and should never be attempted without careful analysis of the preexisting character of central-local ties.},

abstract = {China's economic growth and transition pose fascinating questions for social scientists. In the economic realm, proponents of the market-preserving federalism (MPF) model appear to have gone too far. In reality, China's central leadership has retained the prerogative to appoint top provincial officials as well as the power to reconfigure central-provincial fiscal relations, thus defying predictions of the MPF model. In the social realm, rapid growth has propelled the expansion of the middle class, but the large increase in inequality has sharpened social cleavages and class conflicts. The uncertainties of market transition and rising social conflicts pose major challenges for the ruling elite and for China's political development.},

abstract = {As the Republic of China (ROC) enters into the 1990s, its political system is under tremendous pressure to adapt to its changing internal and external environments. The purposes of this article are: to present the arguments as to why the ROC urgently needs a new world perspective; to propose a new outlook for the ROC toward its external environment, and finally, to identify the areas wherein the ROC must develop new perspectives, so as to charter a course of policy planning which will be beneficent, not only for the government and people in Taiwan, but also for the Chinese people as a whole. Following a detailed analysis of the internal situation as well as the external environment of the ROC, this article puts forward a series of suggestions regarding a new world perspective for the ROC. First, it argues for a positive and active policy toward mainland China aimed at "peaceful transformation," while putting off political negotiation until a later date. Second, it suggests the adoption of the "multi-system nations" concept coupled with the application of "dual recognition" schemes as a progressive strategy for expanding the diplomatic front of the ROC. And finally, the author reminds the leaders of the ROC government that elite solidarity and future-oriented policy planning are the two key factors which will determine whether or not the ROC will successfully overcome its present and future challenges and pave the way for a higher level of national development in the twenty-first century.},

abstract = {The end of the Cold War has brought about a new strategic architecture in the Asia-Pacific region, especially in East Asia. The evolution of Russo-Chinese relations has been one of the most significant changes in this regard with many speculating that the past enmity has been replaced by a new amity with the 'Russia-China strategic axis' brought about by 'pull' and 'push' factors a high possibility. The viability of this claim, and the potentials and limits of this development are the objects of this article. The article argues that a 'Russo-Chinese partnership' has emerged but falls far short of an 'axis' due to abiding gee-political and gee-strategic divergence of long term interests.},

@article{Gallagher2002a,
abstract = {Most theories that seek to explain democratization look to changes in the economy as the precursor to significant political liberalization, locating the main causal factor in either severe economic crisis or rapid economic growth. In the Chinese context, by contrast, the Communist Party has extricated itself from the socialist social contract with the urban working class without losing its grip on political power. Moreover, China has maintained a rapid pace of economic growth for over twenty-five years without significant political liberalization. Comparative analysis of China's post-1978 reform policies yields insights both across types of socialist transition, comparing China with Eastern Europe and Russia, and across time, comparing China with other high-growth East Asian economics. A key factor in China's ability, to reform the economy without sacrificing political control is the timing and sequencing of its foreign direct investment (FDI) liberalization. There arc two key variables that are important to this comparative analysis: China's pattern of ownership diversification and China's mode of integration into the global economy. The article relates these two variables to the success of economic change without political liberalization, in particular, how FDI liberalization has affected relations between workers and the ruling Communist Party. "Reform and openness" in this context resulted in a strengthened Chinese state, a weakened civil society (especially labor), and a delay in political liberalization.},

The paper is aimed at presenting the approaches used for learners’ profiles characterization. Learners’ profiles characterization is here intended with respect to the learning strategies used by learners from one side; from the other, with respect to different ways of non linear navigation. In both cases the focus is on the effectiveness of data driven approaches in detecting individual differences. It is shown that, in both cases, data driven approaches are able to detect such individual differences. Therefore, it can be concluded that data driven approaches are effective for learners’ profiling, and that their employment can be beneficial for improving personalization of learning environments.},

This article argues that the possibility of the emergence of such a 'strategic triangle' remains quite low given the present structure of international politics, where the USA has more comprehensive ties with Russia, China, and India than any two of them have between themselves. Moreover, though bilateral ties among the three states in question have improved in recent years, much more effort is required to bring them to the footing of a meaningful strategic relationship. Not only are Russia, China, and India too weak to balance US power in any significant measure, but the allure of US power remains too strong for them to resist.},

abstract = {Due to the impact of the 1989 pro-democracy movement and the political changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, the CCPs Fourteenth National Congress failed to further the reform of the political structure, a task initiated by the previous congress. The decision of the last congress to restrict the Party's leadership to political matters was abandoned while the definition of the Party's Twelfth National Congress that the Party exercises political, ideological and organizational leadership was readopted. Previous efforts to separate the functions of the Party from those of the government were undermined when top Party cadres assumed important concurrent posts in the government. In the wake of the Party's Fourteen th National Congress, the focus of discussion was organizational streamlining, which does not affect the Party's rule and is the easiest of all political restructuring tasks. So far, the efforts to separate government administration from enterprise management have not produced much result. However, as state-run enterprises become state-owned enterprises according to the decision of the congress, enterprises will have greater autonomy. How can Party committees in enterprises help factory directors and fulfill their ''guaranteeing and supervising role without causing excessive interference? This will be a severe lest.},

abstract = {The last decade has witnessed a great interest in e-learning and Web based education areas. Unfortunately, most of the e-learning environments used in the educational field today are still delivering the same educational resources and services in the same way to different learners. Hence, observing the increasing need for personalization in e-learning systems, we aim to make these systems deliver the most appropriate content to learners according to their interests and needs. This paper outlines the use of on-line automatic recommendations in e-learning systems based on learners’ access history. First we start by mining learner profiles using usage Web mining techniques and content-based profiles using information retrieval techniques. Then, we use these profiles to compute relevant links to recommend for an active learner by applying a number of recommendation strategies. },

abstract = {The emergence of a new triangle among the LTS, Japan, and China has overshadowed the preceding relationship among the US, the former Soviet Union, and China although the structure is relatively infantile, unstable and loose. Due to the radical shift in power capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region, and theluctuation in economic, technological, military, political, and socio-economic foundations of national power, the bilateral basis of the triangular structure is move unstable than was the case in the past. Diverging political structures, decision-making systems, belief systems, leadership factors, misperceptions, as well as systemic dynamics are impacting on individual state behavior. The significance of internal sources of foreign policy is nowhere more important than the inter-Korean process, where weapons proliferation, and possible regime collapse pose serious security challenges. The concerned outside powers must recognize the inherent limitations of their influence on Pyongyang's evolution, and the domestic conditions that drive Pyongyang's adventurous policy. Here, the recognition that only Kim Jong-il as of this moment can drive through any limited reform in the context of military/political guarantees to his regime, most probably from China and Russia, and possibly from the LIS, and South Korea must be made. In order to facilitate this process, outside powers must encourage "reKoreanization" of the inter-Korean process. In this regard, a gradual autonomization of national security in South Korea is essential.},

abstract = {This paper centers on elaborating a sequence path of the forty years of the Sino-North Korean alliance by employing several standards that explain why alliances endure or collapse. The sequence path began when China's threat perceptions began changing in the early 1970s. The next stage witnessed significant decline in China's credibility as an alliance partner As a result, the third stage showed North Korea's increasing secondary alliance dilemma that was further stimulated by the collapse of the communist world and the end of the Cold War As a solution, North Korea bandwagoned with the United States. The final picture of this ongoing sequence path has appeared with North Korea's maneuvering between Washington and Beijing, as well as China's attempts to preserve its traditional sphere of influence against encroachment by the United States. This paper concludes that the alliance is being transformed from an ideological military alliance to a new triangular security relationship between North Korea, China, and the United States. In accordance, North Korea is becoming increasingly autonomous in its alliance with China. In so doing, Pyongyang is attempting to play one superpower off against the other much as it succeeded in doing with the former Soviet Union and China. China, in turn, is compelled to defend its traditional sphere of geopolitical influence. North Korea will be involved in the corning conflict between China and the United States during the twenty-first century.},

abstract = {This article considers the impact of China's insertion into the global political economy on the nature of political power in China. It argues that for most of the period of the transition from socialism, state leaders attempted to protect domestic interests where possible from the perceived detrimental impacts of globalization. However, China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) marked a key shift in this strategy. Through the creation of an international coalition for reform, key state leaders used WTO entry as a tool to enforce change on reluctant domestic constituents, rather than the earlier strategy of protecting them from competition and change. While domestic reform efforts have been responsible for many of the changes to the Chinese regime, external actors and interests have also played an important role in altering the fundamentals of politics in the People's Republic of China, and in particular, changing the raison d'etre of Communist Party rule.},

abstract = {Metadata attempts to describe the content, format, purpose and structure of data. Over the past few years, the IEEE-LOM standard has dominated the metadata world in e-learning applications. However, with the advent of the Semantic Web, elearning applications are beginning to evolve their metadata representation from these standards by adding semantic structure or by converting entirely to semantic representations of structure. This shift enables the implementation of a range of new tools which can reason over the metadata, providing added value from the stored data. This review paper summarizes this evolution of metadata used in e-learning applications from standards to semantic representation.},

abstract = {The emergence of private entrepreneurs in China, which is one of the most dramatic changes that China's economic reforms have engendered, has largely been evaluated from an economic perspective. Most scholarly research on private entrepreneurs, dominated by whether they pursue democratic political change or not, underestimates the political impact of their emergence. In contrast, by examining the changes that have occurred in the political status of private entrepreneurs, this article suggests that their emergence is important politically, too. In the reform era, private entrepreneurs have increasingly pursued political representation, taking posts in various political organizations. In addition, they have developed their voice and asserted their interests by exploiting the political positions they hold. Playing an important role in the policy process and exerting influence over the policies and regulations that affect themselves, private entrepreneurs have moved from the fringe to the center of the Chinese political system.},

A preview of aggregate statistics and broader reform measures indicate the declining role of the state. However, a systematic analysis of administrative, service and enterprise structures reveal the nuances of how the state has retained strong capacity to guide development of the agricultural sector. State and Party policy makers aim not only to support the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of farmers, but also to pursue agricultural modernization in the context of rapid industrialization. These goals are unlikely to be achieved through a wholesale transfer of functions to the private sector, so the state has maintained or developed new mechanisms of influence, particularly in the areas of service provision and enterprise development.},

abstract = {All the citizen are concerned with the use analysis of computer based learning. We propose in this paper a state of art on why and how analyse usage of technology-based learning environments. Three aspects have been studied: use analysis in a large point of view, traking and analysing usages and what’s on Design Pattern. Today, in the field of technology-based learning environments, a research domain focuses on the concept of learning track in order to improve control and progress of computer-based learning situations. A learning track can be a production explicitly linked to the learning task (creation of a text, answering a question, etc.), or more implicit indices reflecting learner's behaviour or characteristics. An element of complexity is in collecting, filtering and structuring these raw tracks and to give them a so pertinent meaning to allow a human or artificial agent to observe, evaluate or regulate learning situations. One main goal of the DPULS JEIRP is to isolate recurrent patterns in those different steps of digital processing of tracks. The objective of this state of art is to present actual works about tracking in order to isolate possibilities of patterns. },

@article{Dent2005a,
abstract = {Regional economic relations in East Asia have experienced a period of profound change since the 1997/98 financial crisis. Two developments are particularly notable. The first relates to the ASEAN Plus Three (APT) framework, under which an increasingly coalescent regional economic grouping has emerged in East Asia. Thus far, APT member states (Japan, China, South Korea and the ASEAN group) have devoted much energy to creating new mechanisms of regional financial governance, such as the Chiang Mai Initiative and Asian Bond Market Initiative. The second development concerns the expansion of bilateral free trade agreement (FFA) projects in East Asia and the Asia-Pacific. Many see this as a precursor to forging wider sub-regional or regional trade agreements. Both developments mark a potentially significant shift from regionalization to regionalism in East Asia, and thus "high politics" becomes defacto more important given regionalism is largely founded on inter-(nation-)state agreements. Beijing's continued ardent contestation of Taiwan's nation-statehood has hence limited Taiwan's ability to engage as it would like in East Asia's new regional political economy. This article considers the nature of regional political economy and applies it to the recent East Asian experience, which in turn provides an analytical framework for examining the significance of the APT framework and new FIFA trend, and Taiwan's position in relation to them. Special attention is paid to Taiwan's prospects in East Asia's new regional political economy.},

The Chinese elite have engaged in the changes with the preservation of the repressive aspects of Communist regime. This ensures stability and lead to the rise of China's economy. Russia dismantled the Communist regime with its repressive/controlling aspect and this lead to Russia's steady decline. At the same time Russia could express revival if it would follow the Chinese way.},

@article{Odgaard2007,
abstract = {The article presents an analysis of the post-Cold War dynamics of power-balancing between the United States and China, and the role great powers and middle powers such as ASEAN Russia, South Korea, Japan and India play in this process. It makes a contribution to the ongoing debate on the U.S.-China relationship by showing how divergent U.S.-China policies in key areas such as anti-terror and anti-WMD initiatives, democracy and human rights, the U.S. alliance system and the UN system contribute to unstable patterns of power balancing in the Asia-Pacific. The article argues that the main flaws in Chinese policies on Asia-Pacific security come to the fore in Northeast Asia, which is a stronghold of the U.S. alliance system and China's near abroad, thus affecting China's influence on global security. If China cannot accommodate the region into its overall foreign policy strategy, its suggestions for a post-Cold War security order are likely to appear unconvincing to the international community. The article points out that the main flaws in U.S. policies on Asia-Pacific security come to the fore in Southeast, Central and South Asia, where Washington's concerns to preserve its pre-eminence prompts it to compromise on core foreign policy principles such as its anti-WMD measures and its policies on the political legitimacy of regimes. These flaws encourage the majority of regional states to extend partial support to the Chinese version of regional order without departing from the U.S. security umbrella. The article concludes that Sino-U.S. policies on the regional order result in patterns of power-balancing not underpinned by coexistence, an order that may be called "stable instability," because it is likely to remain in place as the regional order of the Asia-Pacific for the foreseeable future.},

abstract = {Economic development and internal security are the considerations that dominate foreign, security, and military policies of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Beyond these immediate concerns, the Chinese are determined to achieve the international status and influence of a ''great power.'' To achieve that, they are building ''great power'' armed forces. Chinese policies and actions often seem aggressive to their neighbors. Much of this behavior stems from fundamental assumptions about China's special status in Asia. Although Peking (Beijing) denies seeking ''hegemony,'' China's neighbors note the PRC's military doctrine of ''limited and regional wars,'' and the growing power projection capability of the People's Liberation Army (PLA). At the logical extreme of the PRC's ''hegemonist'' aspiration is a willingness to intervene militarily if a neighbor's behavior goes ''out of bounds,'' or if it gets too close to an outside power. The PRC's treatment of Vietnam is a prime example, as is its more recent policy toward Mongolia. The Chinese sincerely want to be friendly and cooperative. However, they assume that they should be the dominant regional power, and that other powers, including the United States, should recognize and defer to their regional interests. The Japanese are their only strong rival for regional hegemony. Accordingly, PLA officers regard Japan as a long-term military threat, while others in the region fear a Sino-Japanese arms race.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates how we use semantic web technologies to improve the state-of-the-art in e-learning environments and bridge the gap between students and learning-content authors/teachers. In particular, we use our Learning Object Context Ontology (LOCO) framework to formalise the notion of learning object context as a complex interplay of learning activities, learning objects and learners. In addition, we rely on semantic annotation for establishing semantic relations among diverse learning artefacts (e.g. lessons and chat messages). These technologies enabled us to implement a number of feedback types (identified by interviewing several web-oriented professional educators) for content authors and teachers to help them improve their online courses. The implemented feedback is integrated in a tool named LOCO-Analyst, which actually extends the well-known learning content packing tool Reload Editor. LOCO-Analyst is tested on the real data obtained from the iHelp Courses Learning Content Management System and is evaluated by several educational practitioners.},

Zhao and Bhowmick, 2003: Sequential Pattern Mining (s. Referenzen)

        

        
Problem: Semantische Modellierung verl\"{a}sst sich sehr auf die Verbindung zwischen dem modellierten Entit\"{a}ten, so wie es mir scheint. Es w\"{a}re wohl auch sinnvoll, \"{a}hnlich wie im Feedback 1 bei der groben Erfassung des Schwierigkeitsgrades eines Themas (Time/L\"{a}nge), w\"{a}re es sinnvoll auch f\"{u}r die anderen Ans\"{a}tze Kennwerte festzulegen.

        
S.59: Arten des Feedbacks interessant:

        
a. Quizzschw\"{a}che: -> generell schlecht: Problem beim Sch\"{u}ler, nur ein Quizz schlecht: evtl. Organisation des Lernmaterials (wichtig f\"{u}r Lehrer)
b. Gemeinsame Lernstrategien von guten und schlechten Sch\"{u}lern -> Pattern Mining!
c. Schwierige Lerneinheiten: Ratio: Textl\"{a}nge/Zeit + Revisits
d. Probleme von Studenten mit gewissen Lerneinheiten wird sichtbar in Quizzeinheiten: Antworten, die von der Mehrzahl der Studenten nicht gel\"{o}st wurden. Verbindung zur Lerneinheit und Stunde wird \"{u}ber semantische Beziehung m\"{o}glich
Ebenso werden die semantischen Beziehungen von Kommunikationen beleuchtet um weitere Hinweise zu finden. - > soziale Interaktion
e. Soziale Interaktion: Topic Recognition wird verwendet
f. Engagement der Studenten: Betrifft Auswertung des Aktivit\"{a}tsgrades. WElche Kontakte h\"{a}ufig oder weniger usw.

        
S. 61: Der Loco-Analyst

        
Informiert \"{u}ber
a. Aktivit\"{a}ten der Studenten innerhalb des LCMS
b. Benutzung des Lernmaterials
c. Besonderheiten der sozialen Aktivit\"{a}ten der Studenten

        
S.62: Technik:
* Suche von Daten: Semantische Abfragesprache auf Basis von RDF
* Content Annotation: Automatische Datenanreicherung die nicht nur Unterichtseinheiten anreichert, sondern auch die Chat-Kommunikation. Verwedenung finden die Java-Frameworks GATE und KIM (f\"{u}r Informationsmanagement)
* Feedback: Basiert auf den Modellen von LO Context-Daten (schon modelliert)

        
*Update Facility: Frischt st\"{a}ndig die LOCs mit neuen Infos auf. Mapping Usage Tracking Data -> LOC-Data

        

        
S.63: Beschreibung der Ontologien

        
S.66: Achtung: es werden nat\"{u}rlich nicht nur die beantworteten Fragen mit einbezogen, sondern eben auch die nicht beantworteten!

        
->ok: S. 61 bezieht sich auf Text Recognition Ans\"{a}tze um soziale von nicht sozialen Themen zu trennen. -> bezieht weitere Techniken mit ein, wie: enth\"{a}lt der Text Feedback, Beschwerde etc.},

abstract = {When Russia emerged in early 1992 as the successor to the Soviet Union in the international arena, its foreign policy favored the West, but at the end of the year, it had shifted attention to the ''near abroad'' and the East. From that time on, relations between the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Russia have dynamically developed. Border problems have been largely resolved; economic ties have improved; and the military connections are not only substantial, but also alarming. Along with these obvious achievements, difficulties and problems still remain. However, Sino-Russian relations are by and large moving from full normalization to ''constructive partnership.'' This improved relationship will certainly influence the Asia-Pacific region as well as the rest of the world.},

abstract = {Russia's President Vladimir Putin has centralized decision making in Moscow and has reduced the role of domestic actors. He has demonstrated his own personal management of foreign policy in relation to China and Japan. He has used negotiations over oil and territory to place Russia in a more favourable position between them. In relation to oil, he has overruled the oil company Yukos and others within his own government and decided in favour of the Japanese pipeline route, which includes a branch line to China. Putin decided on the Japanese route because it promised access to wider markets in the Asia Pacific, besides China. It also entailed deeper Japanese involvement in Russia's development and reduced Russian dependence upon China. In terms of territory, Putin undermined the power of local opposition and offered territorial settlements to both China and Japan, to remove sources of future tension. With China he compromised over the river islands which had been left outstanding since the main border agreement was signed in 1991. To Japan he again offered a compromise over the disputed islands based on the 1956 agreement to improve relations. Russians may hope that energy dependence would induce the Japanese to become more willing to compromise over the territorial issue. The Japanese, however, expect that Russia's need for funding for the pipeline would allow them to resist that pressure and to demand a return of all disputed islands. If Russia emerges as an energy supplier to both China and Japan its influence and its regional role would be enhanced. Much depends upon the prospects for the oil pipeline and its branch line, whose feasibility has been questioned.},

abstract = {The issue of China's Northeast Project is minor when juxtaposed against other important problems in Northeast Asia. However, this issue is more than a simple matter of historical interpretation. The Northeast Project dispute between Korea and China involves many factors, including that of national sovereignty and the balance of power in Northeast Asia. Many Korean scholars insist that the Northeast Project was just an effort to promote "historical hegemony" in a systematic and organized manner by the Chinese government. They believe that China is distorting the history of Goguryeo (Koguryo) in order to secure preemptive lights in the region in preparation for the collapse of North Korea. But, in order for this analysis to be justified, a comprehensive study should be undertaken to determine the role and intent of the Chinese central government regarding the Northeast Project, and China's policy towards Northeast Asia and the Korean peninsula. Though the political implications of the Northeast Project have been amplified beyond objective facts, it is hard to deny that China has begun adjusting to the existing realities in the Korean peninsula through the Northeast Project. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a scholarly basis for a foreign policy that separates historical sovereignty from territorial sovereignty. Another solution is to spread and deepen the Korean-Chinese historical discourse.},

From that time on, relations between the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Russia have dynamically developed. Border problems have been largely resolved; economic ties have improved; and the military connections are not only substantial, but also alarming. Along with these obvious achievements, difficulties and problems still remain. However, Sino-Russian relations are by and large moving from full normalization to ''constructive partnership.'' This improved relationship will certainly influence the Asia-Pacific region as well as the rest of the world.},

abstract = {The Chinese government has recently focused on the need to increase consumption to rebalance the economy. A widely held view is that despite China’s remarkably high growth, the share of consumption in total expenditure has been low and declining due to high and rising saving rate of Chinese households as uncertainty over provision of pensions, and healthcare and education costs have increased since the mid-1990s. This paper finds that the rise in saving rate has been a minor factor. Much larger has been the role of the declining share of household income in national income, which has occurred across-the-board in wages, investment income, and government transfers. The paper finds that financial sector weaknesses, by restricting firms’ access to bank financing for working capital, have played quantitatively a major role in keeping wage and investment income shares low and on a declining trend.},

I argue that democratic transitions are an important cause of foreign-policy realignment with the United States and, furthermore, that the nature of that realignment is conditioned by whether the United States supported the previous nondemocratic regime. American support, or lack thereof, for the ancien r\'{e}gime structures the domestic politics of democratic transitions. In the absence of previous U.S. support, democratization commonly leads to positive foreign-policy realignment toward the United States. Conversely, when the United States supports nondemocratic regimes, democratic transitions rarely produce positive realignment. I use an original data set of country– year dyads with the United States from 1950 to 2000. Using Markov Transition regression models, I find that the interaction of democratic transition and previous U.S. support is a powerful determinant of foreign-policy realignment. This research has important implications for international relations theory and American foreign policy.},

abstract = {This study investigated request and refusal strategies in the question-response sequences of interactions in routine press conferences held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China and the US Department of State oil the topic of the North Korea nuclear crisis during a period of 5 months. All utterances by journalists were identified as requests, and instances of spokespersons' non-compliance with requests were considered to be refusals. Findings demonstrated that: (1) request for specific information was the most frequently adopted strategy in both US and Chinese press conferences, but more clarification and confirmation questions were used in the US data and more questions for comments were found in the Chinese data: (2) in the case of refusals. direct refusals and reasons for refusal were frequent in the US data while avoidance and insufficient answers were prevalent in the Chinese data. The cross-cultural differences in the strategies of requests and refusals arc discussed briefly in relation to different ideological and cultural assumptions.},

This article sets out some of the major analytical questions that emerge when thinking about the foreign policy options of these countries and some of the principal conceptual and theoretical categories within which those questions may be usefully framed. The first section examines the reasons for taking these countries as a group. The second section provides a brief overview of two of the most common theoretical perspectives from which the systemic pressures on these countries have been understood. The third considers their actual and potential strategies and options under five headings: their status as regional powers; their behaviour within and towards international institutions; their relations with the United States; collaboration among them and evidence for the possible emergence of balancing behaviour; and the links between economic development and foreign policy.},

abstract = {I examine the causes and dynamics of democratic consolidation. I develop a new, change-point model of democratic consolidation that avoids some of the pitfalls of many existing empirical studies of consolidation. Specifically, rather than assuming that consolidation occurs, the present model estimates whether and when consolidation occurs as a function of covariates. I apply this approach to new data on democratic survival that distinguish between two processes by which an overwhelming majority of authoritarian reversals occurs: coups d’´etat and incumbent takeovers. I find that the risk of authoritarian reversals by each of the two processes differs in its dynamic as well as determinants: democracies consolidate against the risk of coups but do not consolidate against the risk of incumbent takeovers. I discuss the theoretical implications of these empirical findings.},

abstract = {The nature of the political culture itself is often seen by commentators as the cause of democracy failing to take root in China; the antidemocratic elements of that culture being overemphasised while the democratic elements are underemphasised. This paper examines the application of the ideas of democratic culture in China to the current state of play, including the possibility of the democratic card being played by factions within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). There are indeed cultural problems associated with Chinese democratisation such as cultural anomie, unconscious authoritarian personalities, the legacy of egalitarianism, the radical polarisation of Chinese culture, difficulties of institutional compromise and the irrational control of aggression and fear. While the antidemocratic culture is stronger at present than the democratic culture, the new Chinese democratic culture is likely to gather strength in the future.},
